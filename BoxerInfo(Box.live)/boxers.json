  "description": "A powerful knockout artist, Anthony Joshua helped revitalize the heavyweight division. Although he started his boxing career somewhat late, he quickly ascended up the amateur ranks and ended up winning an Olympic gold medal at super heavyweight, and then later the IBF heavyweight title, making him only the second British boxer to win gold at the Olympics and also a world title.\nBorn in Watford, England to Nigerian parents, Joshua spent his early years back and forth between the United Kingdom and Nigeria. By the middle of his Year Seven, he was in the United Kingdom full time at Kings Langley Secondary School. He was always a natural athlete, as he did well in football and also ended up breaking the 100-meter record for Year Nine students when he ran it in just 11.6 second.\nWhile he did a couple sessions of boxing training with his father at 15, he wasn\u2019t interested in the sport at the time, preferring weightlifting and spending time with his friends. In 2007 when he was 18, he really committed to the sport and started training full time. This meant he was getting to it later than most, although athletic heavyweights can get away with that.\nHe had immediate success when he started competing as an amateur, as he ended up winning both the 2009 and 2010 Haringey Box Cup, followed by the Senior ABA Championships in 2010. Despite his success in the ring, Anthony Joshua had his share of problems outside of it. He had been getting in trouble with the law since he was 16, at one point throwing another player over his shoulders during a game of football. That resulted in an official warning. He also got in his fair share of street fights, one of which led to him being on remand in Reading. His success in boxing didn\u2019t lead him down the right path immediately, as even after he started collecting those amateur tournament trophies, he still got arrested in 2010 for having marijuana in his car.\nDespite these issues, the heavyweight didn\u2019t let himself get off track, as he continued to focus on his goals of winning tournaments. Despite an offer of 50,000 pounds to fight professionally in 2010, he turned it down because he wanted to remain an amateur. He instead took a place on the GB Boxing team, and he ended up winning the 2010 GB Amateur Boxing Championships. He took a step up in competition the next year when he fought in the 2011 European Amateur Boxing Championships, but a southpaw, Mihai Nistor, ended up stopping him.\nThe 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships served as a coming out party for the boxer. Despite having only 4 years of experience at the time, he beat the tournament\u2019s reigning champion Roberto Cammarelle and followed it up with a victory in the semifinals. He faced off with Magomedrasul Majidov in the finals but lost by just a point, ending up with the silver medal. His tournament performance was good enough to earn him a place in the 2012 Olympics.\nHis draw at the Olympics was far from easy, and he had a tough opening round against Cuban Erislandy Sav\u00f3n. He ended up taking a close and highly controversial victory, 17-16, although most of the people in the crowd didn\u2019t agree with it. His next bout was a more decisive 15-11 victory over Zhang Zhilei, who he knocked down in the second round. The semifinals saw the 6\u20196\u201d boxer at a rare height disadvantage against Ivan Dychko, but he still managed to prevail with another close victory, this one coming 13-11. In the finals, he once again fought Roberto Cammarelle, and this match was far closer.\nHe lost the first two rounds by 1 and 2 points, respectively, but then stormed back in the third round to tie it up at 18-18. On the countback, he was crowned the winner. Like his first fight, this result also attracted some controversy, although fans were impressed with the way he fought back in the final round.\nHaving conquered the highest level of amateur boxing, Anthony Joshua turned pro in 2013. In his very first contest on October 5, 2013, he showed off his devastating power with a first-round knockout win against Emanuele Leo. He continued to pick up knockouts and TKOs on his way to a WBC heavyweight title fight against Denis Bakhtov at the 02 Arena in London. In front of his home crowd, he dominated Bakhtov and scored a second-round TKO, winning his first title just over a year into his professional career.\nAfter another four finishes, he picked up another belt when he defeated Gary Cornish by first-round TKO and won the vacant Commonwealth heavyweight title. His next fight was for the vacant British heavyweight title, along with his own WBC and Commonwealth heavyweight titles. It was also against an opponent he had a history with in Dillian Whyte. The two had fought previously as amateurs in 2009, and Whyte had picked up the win. Whyte tagged Joshua with a hard shot in the second round, but the champion showed that he could take a punch by hanging in there and fighting back, eventually knocking Whyte out in round seven. It was the longest either fighter had fought at that point in their careers.\nWith that win, he had earned his first shot at a world heavyweight title, in this case the IBF belt held by Charles Martin. The fight took place at his usual stomping grounds, the 02 Arena, and he didn\u2019t disappoint. He picked up a second-round knockout to the delight of his many fans in attendance. He would go on to defend his IBF heavyweight title multiple times.\nAs a boxer, Joshua is the total package. Despite starting late, he has sharp technical skills, and he boasts superb athleticism. And, of course, the fans love a knockout puncher, and he has shown that he possesses that kind of brutal, fight-changing power.",

  "description": "Dereck Chisora is a British professional boxer who has held the British and Commonwealth heavyweight titles as well as the European Heavyweight Title. Chisora has a rough, brawling style that can bedevil more clinical boxers.\nChisora was born in Mbare, which is a suburb of Harare, the Zimbabwe capital city. In 1999, his family moved to Finchley, London. In 2002, he was involved in a street fight and was arrested for assault after knocking out a victim\u2019s teeth. Soon after, his parole officer suggested that he take up boxing. He was trained by Joe Smyth on the fundamental aspects of boxing and turned pro in 2007.\nDereck Chisora won his first fight with a second round TKO against Istvan Kecskes. He won his next three fights by decision before fighting future Commonwealth Champion Sam Sexton. He won by TKO with 30 seconds left in the final round. He went onto win his first eight fights before being suspended for four months for biting Paul Butlin in their 2009 fight. This suspension caused him to miss his scheduled fight for the British title against Danny Williams.\nDereck Chisora and Williams struggled for a year to reschedule the fight before finally meeting in May 2010. Chisora won easily with a TKO in the second round, winning the British heavyweight title. In September of 2010, he defeated Sam Sexton for a second time, this time by knockout in the 9th round and gained the Commonwealth Heavyweight Title. It was in 2010 that he was found guilty of assault against his girlfriend and given a suspended 12 week prison sentence.\nHe received his first and second losses to Tyson Fury and in a split decision to Robert Helenius in Finland. The result was highly controversial and Helenius actually dropped in the rankings despite his victory. Despite the loss, Dereck was scheduled to fight Vitali Klitschko in Munich in February 2012. Klitschko had the height and reach advantage and used his length to keep Chisora, with his powerful, brawling style, from getting inside and landing body blows. Klitschko won the fight by unanimous decision. Chisora was arrested but not charged after a post fight press conference brawl with David Haye.\nAfter the brawl with Haye, the British Boxing Board of Control suspended Dereck Chisora\u2019s boxing license indefinitely under the condition that he must take anger management treatment before he would be reinstated. Despite not being reinstated, he was able to use a boxing license from another country to fight David Haye. He lost the fight by TKO after being repeatedly knocked down in the fifth round.\nChisora won his next five fights while trying to clean up his image. Gone were the pre-fight confrontations as he aimed to show more respect to his opponents. However, he lost again to Tyson Fury after he was ruled unable to continue in the tenth round. After the Fury fight, he ran off a streak of five consecutive victories. He ended 2016 with a loss to Dillian Whyte in a fight for the WBC international heavyweight title.",

  "description": "A towering heavyweight fighting out of New Zealand, Joseph Parker was born in South Auckland on January 9, 1992. His father, Dempsey, was named after legendary American pugilist Jack Dempsey and trained young Joseph starting at only three years of age. When he was 10, he started training at Papatoetoe Boxing Club.\nHe began fighting as an amateur two years later when he was 12, and he ended up achieving quite a bit of success. In 2009, he won the New Zealand Golden Gloves Tournament. In 2010 and 2011, he was the nation\u2019s amateur heavyweight champion. His final amateur match was a victory over Johan Linde, the gold medalist at the 2012 Olympics, to win gold at the Belgrade annual boxing tournament.\nParker was being hyped up quite a bit before his professional debut on July 5, 2012 against Dean Garmonsway, and he performed well in scoring a second-round TKO. His next fight was a second-round KO, and then he earned two more TKOs, each time showing off improved skills and natural punching power. He showed that he had the ability to go the distance in his next fight on May 16, 2013, winning a six-round unanimous decision over Brice Ritani-Coe.\nHe took a big step up in competition for his next fight, which was against long-time heavyweight contender Francois Botha, albeit on the downside of his career. Still, Joseph Parker showed he could stop high-level fights, as he notched another TKO in round two. That earned him his first title shot on October 10, 2013, as he fought Afa Tatupu for the NZNBF heavyweight belt. Once again, it was a dominant performance, as he won again by second-round TKO.\nNext, he traveled to Oberhausen, Germany to fight Marcelo Luiz Nascimento for the PABA interim heavyweight title, which he won after winning by TKO in the seventh round. He went back to New Zealand for his next fight, where he stopped Brian Minto after seven rounds and picked up the WBO Oriental heavyweight title for his troubles. Parker would go on to defend his belts several times.\nRunning his record to 14-0, he then fought Bowie Tupou for the WBO Africa and OPBF heavyweight titles. It didn\u2019t take him long, as he won the fight by KO in the very first round. In his next fight, a third-round TKO over Kali Meehan, he added the EPBC and WBA Oceania heavyweight belts to his collection.\nNearing the end of 2016, Joseph Parker had built up an impressive 21-0 record with 18 victories by stoppage, and perhaps most impressive was how little he had been tested. With his power and skill, it was clear he had potential to be a force in the division. On December 10, 2016, he fought for the WBO heavyweight title against Andy Ruiz. It was a close, competitive contest with both men having their moments. Ruiz was the sharper fighting in the early going and towards the end of the fight, but Parker took the middle rounds, which was enough to earn him the majority decision victory. This made him the first man from New Zealand to win a major heavyweight championship.",

  "description": "Born on June 11, 1989 in Birmingham, West Midlands, England, Khalid Yafai has been successful at both the amateur and professional levels. Despite fighting at super flyweight, he possesses solid punching power to complement his considerable boxing skills.\nStarting his boxing training at a young age, Yafai was named Junior Sportsman of the Year by the BBC Midlands in 2005 for winning the World Cadet title. He qualified for the 2008 Olympics, but was defeated by Andry Laffita, who went on to win silver. At the 2010 European Championships, he won the silver medal. However, he wasn\u2019t able to make the 2012 Olympics boxing team, so he decided to turn pro, instead.\nHis first pro fight was on July 7, 2012 against Delroy Spencer, and it didn\u2019t last long. Khalid Yafai won after a stoppage after the second round, which is to be expected against a fighter that was 14-139-3 at the time. His next fight ended even more quickly, as he beat Richard Voros by way of first-round TKO on September 8, 2012. Exactly two weeks later, he took a decision on points after six rounds against Victor Koh.\nYafai was fairly active in the early stages of his career, fighting lower-level competition and winning handily by TKO, KO or clear victories on points. By the end of 2013, he had compiled a perfect 10-0 record, with seven of those wins coming by stoppage. This was enough to earn him a shot at the Commonwealth super flyweight title.\nThat fight was on May 21, 2014, and he fought Yaqub Kareem. In a masterful performance, he worked the body and head beautifully, eventually taking out Kareem with a hard body shot in just the third round. Next was a fight against Herald Molina for the IBF Inter-Continental super flyweight title and he looked even better, winning easily by second-round KO.\nAfter four more wins, he fought for the British super flyweight belt on October 17, 2015 against Jason Cunningham. He was the smaller man, but it didn\u2019t matter, as he scored a knockdown in round five off a slick combination on his way to a 12-round unanimous decision victory. Just under five months later, he fougth Dixon Flores for the WBA Inter-Continental super flyweight title. Flores may have been a game opponent, but he proved no match for Khalid Yafai, who destroyed him for a first-round KO.\nHe would fight three more times in 2016, which ended up being a banner year for him. First, he scored another first-round stoppage, this a TKO over Jozsef Ajtai. He followed that up by defeating Johnson Tellez by TKO in the third round, with this finish coming from a body shot. That set up a fight for his first world title, the WBA super flyweight belt.\nThe fight took place on December 10, 2016 against Luis Concepcion, who brought a 35-4 record into the bout. After Concepcion missed weight, the title was only on the line for Yafai, and he took it with a dominant 12-round unanimous decision where he controlled every round.",

  "description": "Born on June 17, 1987 in Managua, Nicaragua, Roman Gonzalez is an electrifying fighter with lightning-fast combinations and excellent punching power, particularly for a boxer his size. He made his professional debut just weeks after turning 18, knocking out Ramon Urbina in the second round on July 1, 2005. His fights all took place in his home of Nicaragua for the early portion of his career, as he built up a record of 14-0, collecting the WBA Fedecentro and Nicaraguan light flyweight titles, and then the WBA Fedelatin minimumweight title. Gonzalez had his first fight outside of Nicaragua on November 3, 2007 against Eriberto Gejon in Tokyo, Japan. Fans didn\u2019t get to see him for long, but he did make an impression by scoring a beautiful first-round KO.\nIt wasn\u2019t until his 17th fight that he saw the scorecards, winning a unanimous decision over Hiroshi Matsumoto after 10 rounds. On September 15, 2008, he got his first world title fight when he took on Yutaka Niida for the WBA minimumweight belt. He was far too much for his opponent to handle, winning in dominant fashion by fourth-round TKO. After multiple defenses of his title, Roman Gonzalez jumped up to light flyweight on October 24, 2010 to fight Francisco Rosas for the WBA interim title. He took the belt with a second-round KO. The WBA promoted him to its full champion in February of 2011, and he defended it three times by the end of that year.\nWith his strong performances in multiple weight classes and his high-level technical skills, Gonzalez started getting recognition as one of the world\u2019s top pound-for-pound boxers. While he may not have had the biggest names, the fans who watched him appreciated his aggressive style that often led to a finish.\nAfter several title defenses that brought his record up to 39-0, Roman Gonzalez made another jump in weight, going up to flyweight to fight Akira Yaegashi for the WBC, The Ring, and lineal belts. The fight took place on September 5, 2014, and it was another decisive victory for Gonzalez as he won by TKO in the ninth round. He defended those belts over the next year and a half, even getting a chance to showcase his talents at Madison Square Garden with a ninth-round TKO over Brian Viloria.\nOn September 10, 2016, he went up in weight again when he fought the 35-0-1 Carlos Cuadras for the WBC super flyweight title. It wound up being a close, fast-paced fight, with both boxers having their moments. In the end, though, Gonzalez won by unanimous decision after 12 rounds. With his victory, he made history by becoming Nicaragua\u2019s first four-weight world champion, breaking the tie he had with his mentor and friend Alexis Arguello.\nHe had built up a 46-0 record, but he suffered his first loss in his next fight, dropping a majority decision to Srisaket Sor Rungvisai. It was a stunning upset that many didn\u2019t agree with. The judges scored it 114-112, 114-112, and 113-113 even though Roman Gonzalez landed more punches at a higher accuracy rate, and out landed his opponent in 10 out of 12 rounds.",

  "description": "A slick Cuban boxer who has been successful both as an amateur and a professional, Guillermo Rigondeaux is a truly impressive talent. Boxing analysts and trainers consider his amateur career among the greatest of all time, as he compiled an incredible record of 463 wins with only 12 losses. Born on September 30, 1980, Rigondeaux stormed onto the international scene in 2000, winning the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics as a bantamweight.\nThe next six years of his amateur career included a huge collection of gold medals. He won the Cuban national championships every year from 2000 to 2006, and he took gold at the 2003 Pan American Games in Santo Domingo, along with the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games in Cartagena. He won gold medals at the World Amateur Boxing Championships twice, at the 2001 event in Belfast and the 2005 event in Mianyang. He added gold medals from the Boxing World Cup in 2002 at Astana, 2005 at Moscow and 2006 at Baku, and he added another Olympic gold medal to his collection with a 2004 victory in Athens.\nGuillermo Rigondeaux twice defected from Cuba, once in 2007 and then again in 2009. After defecting in 2009, he decided to turn professional. He had to leave behind his wife, son and stepson in Cuba.\nHe had his first professional fight against Juan Noriega, earning a third-round TKO victory in a contest he controlled from the opening bell. Two more early TKOs followed against Robert Guillen and Giovanni Andrade, with the latter victory earning him the WBA-NABA super bantamweight title. After running his record to 6-0, he earned himself a shot at the vacant WBA interim super bantamweight title.\nAlthough his title fight against Ricardo Cordoba was a split decision, most observers felt that Rigondeaux won it decisively. He was more aggressive going forward, as he followed that fight up by stopping Willie Casey in the very first round, and then got a shot at the full WBA super bantamweight title against Rico Ramos. He dominated Ramos from the beginning, knocking him down multiple times and scoring a sixth-round KO.\nAfter two defenses, he fought Nonito Donaire in a unification bout, as Donaire had the WBO, The Ring and lineal super bantamweight titles. Since Donaire was ranked number five on the pound-for-pound lists at the time, it was seen as Rigondeaux\u2019s most difficult fight yet. He ended up winning by unanimous decisions, with the scorecards reading 114-113, 115-112 and 116-111. He did get knocked down in the 10th round, but most observers and analysts felt that he had actually won by a much wider margin, as he landed quite a few hard shots and controlled the majority of the contest.\nHe defended his titles multiple times after the Donaire fight, and added another belt to his collection when he defeated Drian Francisco by unanimous decision. That victory earned him the WBC Silver International super bantamweight title. He followed that up by going to Wales and stopping Jazza Dickens in just two rounds for another successful title defense.",

  "description": "Born on April 10, 1993 in Zama, Kanagawa, Japan, Naoya Inoue lives up to his nickname \u201cThe Monster,\u201d as he comes after other fighters with powerful punches, particularly to the body. He put together a successful amateur career, as he won a few junior tournaments in Japan and competed in the 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships, although he didn\u2019t place. After he didn\u2019t lose in a qualification tournament for the Olympic team, he ended his amateur career with a 75-6 record.\nInoue had his first professional fight on October 2, 2012. Unlike many boxers who start their careers with fights against journeymen, he took on the 16-4-1 Crison Omayao, who was a Filipino champion. Despite the level of competition, he demonstrated his power by knocking out his opponent in the fourth round. In his next fight a few months later, he scored another KO, this one in the very first round.\nHis third opponent was the 17-2-4 Yuki Sano, and Naoya Inoue won that fight by TKO in the 10th and final round. That set him up for a title shot in only the fourth fight of his career, as he took on Ryoichi Taguchi on August 25, 2013 for the Japanese light flyweight title. While this was his first fight to go to a decision, he still put on a show, battering Taguchi with hard shots on his way to a 10-round unanimous decision win.\nOn December 6, 2013, he added another belt to his collection when he took out Jerson Mancio by way of fifth-round TKO for the OPBF light flyweight title. After that, he got his first world title fight, as he was set to fight Adrian Hernandez on April 4, 2014 for the WBC light flyweight belt. Once again, Inoue was dominant, as he finished off his opponent in the sixth round by TKO.\nHe defended that belt one time, against Wittawas Basapean, and won by TKO in the 11th round. Then, he decided to challenge himself by relinquishing his title and jumping up to junior bantamweight to take on Omar Narvaez. Narvaez had an impressive record of 43-1-2, along with the WBO title. It didn\u2019t matter to Inoue, who put Narvaez on the canvas in the first minute of the fight and didn\u2019t let up from there, eventually scoring a knockout in just the second round.\nNaoya Inoue was out of action for almost a year after that, but came back on December 29, 2015 to defend his WBO title for the first time. It didn\u2019t take him long to defeat Warlito Parrenas, as he won by TKO in the second round. On May 8, 2016, he fought David Carmona, who would become just the second fighter to last until a decision against him, but he still picked up the win after 12 rounds. He fought two more times that year. First, he beat Karoon Jarupianlerd in the 10th round by TKO. He then closed out 2016 with another spectacular finish, this one against Kohei Kono in the sixth round of their fight.",

  "description": "Gary Russell Jr. is a professional boxer who was born on June 5, 1988, in Washington, D.C. He knew from a young age that he wanted to have a career in boxing, and that passion paid off handsomely as a teenager. After training throughout most of his childhood, Russell Jr. became one of the best amateur boxers in the country by winning the United States Championships and National Golden Gloves tournaments in 2005 at the age of 16. The dominance in the United States earned him a trip to the 2005 Amateur Boxing World Championships in Mianyang, China. Russell Jr. lost only one fight during the prestigious tournament, but he was still only able to take the bronze medal in the bantamweight division.\nRussell Jr. once again proved that he was the best amateur boxer in his weight class by winning the 2006 U.S Championships. This earned him a trip to the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Chicago, but he ultimately lost in the second round. While Gary was able to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, he never got to compete after missing the final weight-in.\nThe disappointment in Beijing caused Gary Russell Jr. to focus on turning pro. He made his professional boxing debut in a match against Anthony Reyes on January 16, 2009. Russell Jr. won the fight by technical knockout in the third round. After seven straight wins to start the professional career, he fought in his first six-round match against Jairo Delgado on February 19, 2010. He won the fight with a technical knockout in the first round.\nGary Russell Jr. appeared in his first fight scheduled for eight rounds on January 28, 2011. He secured a unanimous technical decision victory over Feider Viloria in the seventh round. The fight was stopped early after Viloria sustained a massive cut from an accidental headbutt. Russell Jr. started his professional career with 18 straight wins before he got to appear in his first 10-round fight. That match occurred on November 26, 2011, against Heriberto Ruiz. While the fight was scheduled to go 10 rounds, Ruiz was knocked out two minutes into the first round.\nAfter starting his professional career with 24 straight wins, Gary Russell Jr. finally got his first world title shot on June 21, 2014. The fight was against Ukraine\u2019s Vasyl Lomachenko for the vacant WBO featherweight title. The Ukrainian was only fighting his third professional match after a record-setting amateur career. Lomachenko dominated most of the fight before winning by a majority decision.\nRussell Jr. did not let the first loss hinder his impressive career. He followed up the loss with a unanimous decision victory over Christopher Martin Pena. This win earned him a shot at Jhonny Gonzalez\u2019s WBC featherweight title on March 28, 2015. Gonzalez was defeated by technical knockout in the fourth round. Gary successfully defended his new WBC featherweight title for the first time against Ireland\u2019s Patrick Hyland at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Montville, Connecticut, on April 16, 2016. Hyland was knocked out in the second round.",

  "description": "Born in Las Vegas, Nevada on November 8, 1991, Jessie Magdaleno comes from an athletic family. Both his brothers boxed, and his father played professional soccer, which he also played as a youth. At seven years old, he decided to start training in boxing because his older brother, Diego, was doing it.\nMagdaleno is right-handed but stands southpaw. He\u2019s about as skilled with his left hand as his right, because he broke his right hand in the fourth grade and learned to write with his left. That dexterity has translated over to the boxing ring, as he has sharp punches that come from all angles.\nJessie Magdaleno had an impressive amateur career, with particularly strong performances at the 2009 U.S. National Championships and the 2009 National Golden Glove Championships. He took gold at both of those tournaments.\nWhile he would have been a contender to win gold at the 2012 Olympics, he was disenchanted with all the judging issues that seemed to occur at every Olympics, so he instead decided to turn pro in 2010. He ended his amateur career with a record of 120-16.\nHis first fight was on November 6, 2010, two days before he turned 19. He took on Matthew Salazar and won by TKO in the first round. He looked like he had been shot out of a cannon, as he came out fast with flurries of punches to get the stoppage. It worked, but it wouldn\u2019t in longer fights, and that\u2019s why his trainer taught him how to slow down and pick his spots better. That whirlwind style may be successful in the amateurs, but not in the pros.\nIn his next fight, he was more measured and defeated Cain Garcia by a third-round TKO. Against Sergio Herrera, he picked up another first-round TKO.\nFor his next two fights, Magdaleno proved that he could go the distance, as he defeated Jonathan Alcantara and Esteban Nichol each by unanimous decision after six rounds. After an active 2011 and 2012, he got his first title shot to close out the year on December 6, 2012. He fought Jonathan Arrellano for the WBO NABO Youth super bantamweight title and picked up win by unanimous decision after eight rounds.\nThat was his first decision win after a streak of four straight victories by KO or TKO, with three of those coming in the first round. He then went on another streak of stoppages, picking up three in a row, although he was out of action from the middle of 2013 until early 2016. Still, his excellent performances earned him a shot at the WBO super bantamweight title.\nThat title fight was on November 5, 2016 against the highly skilled boxer Nonito Donaire. Jessie Magdaleno shocked many observers by coming out strong to open the fight, putting together an early lead. Being a five-division champion, Donaire fought back hard and even nearly picked up a stoppage in the 12th and final round. It wasn\u2019t enough, though, as Magdaleno won the unanimous decision to pick up the belt and run his record to 24-0.",

  "description": "Born on August 10 1988 in Huetamo, Michoacan, Mexico, Leo Santa Cruz started boxing at a young age, like many of the great Mexican fighters. Although he didn\u2019t win any major international tournaments, he did put together an impressive amateur record of 148-7.\nShortly after turning 20, Santa Cruz fought in his first professional boxing match. On October 13, 2006, he took on Pedro Silva, who he defeated by knockout in the second round. He wasn\u2019t as successful in his subsequent bout, as he fought Rodrigo Hernandez to a majority draw after four rounds.\nDespite that minor setback, he started putting together a winning streak over the next several years. Most his victories were by unanimous decision, but towards the end of 2009, he started learning how to put more pop into his punches. On November 3, 2009, he blasted Julio Valadez for a first-round KO. He followed that up with three TKO victories in a row. While none of those were against high-level fighters, his next fight was against the 20-2 Stephane Jamoye for the WBC Youth interim bantamweight title. Leo Santa Cruz took it to the veteran fighter, picking up a KO win in the sixth round.\nHe brought his record to 19-0-1, with nine consecutive stoppages, when he fought Vusi Malinga on June 2, 2012 for the IBF bantamweight title. In his first world title fight, Santa Cruz controlled the proceedings from beginning to end, earning a unanimous decision victory after 12 rounds. He would defend that belt three times before making the decision to go up in weight to the super bantamweight division.\nMaking his debut at his new weight class on May 4, 2013, he beat Alexander Munoz by way of fifth-round TKO, winning the USBA super bantamweight belt in the process. His next fight was even more impressive, as he beat Victor Terrazas by TKO in the third round to add the WBC super bantamweight belt to his collection. He made four title defenses before moving up in weight again, this time to the featherweight division.\nLeo Santa Cruz announced him to the world in his featherweight debut, in no small part because it was occurring on the blockbuster Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight card, which shattered every pay-per-view record. He took full advantage, cruising to a 10-round unanimous decision victory. His next fight was for the WBA featherweight title on August 29, 2015 against Abner Mares. In a classic contest, both men fought hard, but Santa Cruz was able to edge out a majority decision win, staying on the outside just enough to keep himself out of danger.\nHe defended that belt once by beating Kiko Martinez in a slugfest, eventually picking up the fifth-round TKO. However, in his next attempted defense on July 30, 2016, he would lose his belt to Carl Frampton by majority decision in a very close fight. He got a shot at redemption on January 28, 2017 and took full advantage. Although he only won by majority decision, he landed far more punches and got the WBA belt back.",

  "description": "Representing Northern Ireland, Carl Frampton made history as the first boxer from that region to win world titles in two weight divisions. He has picked up numerous championships and accolades over successful amateur and professional careers.\nBorn February 21, 1987 in Tiger\u2019s Bay, Belfast, Frampton began his career training at the Midland Boxing Club. He was successful as an amateur early on, winning the Irish senior flyweight title in 2005. In 2007, he competed in the featherweight division at the European Union Amateur Boxing Championships, which were held in Dublin. He fought his way to the final\u2019s, where he was defeated by Khedafi Djeklhir out of France, ending the tournament with the silver medal. In 2009, he won the Irish featherweight title and decided to end his amateur career with that victory. His amateur record was superb at 114 wins with only 11 losses.\nCarl Frampton made his professional debut shortly after that tournament on June 12, 2009. He fought in England, where he would end up fighting many times over the years, and he faced off against Sandor Szinavel. He scored a second-round TKO victory, announcing himself on the scene in a big way. With two more victories before the end of the year, the Irish National Boxing Awards named him the nation\u2019s prospect of the year early in 2010. He continued to live up to the hype, collecting three more victories before he put on his most impressive performance to that point, stopping Yuri Voronin in a thrilling contest on September 18, 2010.\nThree months later, Frampton was fighting for his first title, this one the vacant British Celtic super-bantamweight belt. He came ready to fight and took out Gavin Reid by way of second-round TKO. By September of 2011, he was adding another belt to his collection. Fighting as a replacement for Kiko Martinez, he scored a fourth-round TKO of Mark Quon to win the vacant Commonwealth super-bantamweight title. He followed that up with two successful defenses of that belt, which earned him a shot for the vacant IBF Inter-Continental super-bantamweight title.\nHe was undefeated at the time, as was his opponent, Ra\u00fal Hirales Jr., a hard-nosed Mexican fighter. In another impressive performance, he controlled the fight from start to finish and ended up with a unanimous decision win. He then defeated Steve Molitor by sixth-round TKO.\nHis next fight, taking place on February 9, 2013, was for the European super-bantamweight title, and it was against the dangerous Spanish fighter Kiko Mart\u00ednez, known for his excellent punching power and his granite chin. Mart\u00ednez had just taken out Bernard Dunne in only 86 seconds to win that European super-bantamweight title, and no man had ever been able to even knock him down in his career. Carl Frampton had scored quite a few TKOs to that point, but he wasn\u2019t known as a power puncher, which is why it was surprising to many when he finished his opponent in the ninth-round by TKO. What made it even sweeter was that he did so in Belfast, in front of his home-town fans.\nHe tore through his next two opponents, first knocking out Jeremy Parodi in the sixth round, and then knocking out Hugo C\u00e1zares with a beautiful left hook in just the second round. That set him up for a shot at the IBF super-bantamweight title, which was somewhat ironically held by a man he had recently defeated in Kiko Mart\u00ednez. Their rematch took place on September 6, 2014, once again in Belfast but this time in an open-air arena. This time around, he scored a knockdown in the fifth round and cruised to a dominant unanimous decision victory, with the final scorecards reading 119-108, 119-108 and 118-111.\nThe Irish boxer defended his title with a brutal beating of Mexican-American boxer Chris Avalos, stopping him in the fifth round. His next fight, which was his first in the United States, proved to be far more difficult. Although he was a significant favorite over Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez Jr., the Mexican fighter knocked him down twice in the very first round, and it looked like there might be an upset brewing. However, Frampton stormed back and took control of an electrifying fight. He won a unanimous decision, with the final score cards reading 116-108, 116-108 and 115-109.\nHis next fight was February 27, 2016 against an opponent he had called out several years prior \u2013 Scott Quigg, an undefeated British fighter who held the WBA super-bantamweight title. At the beginning of the fight, it looked like he would run away with it, as he controlled all the action and evaded Quigg\u2019s punches. In the second half, Quigg made it more of a brawl and the two men traded heavy leather. It was close, but Frampton left with both belts, winning a split decision with scores of 116-112, 116-112 and 113-115.\nWhen he didn\u2019t negotiate a fight with mandatory title challenger Guillermo Rigondeaux, the WBA stripped him of that WBA super-bantamweight title that he had just won. However, he had decided to make a jump in weight class, choosing to take on the undefeated Mexican fighter L\u00e9o Santa Cruz. The fight took place on July 30, 2016 in New York City\u2019s Barclays Centre, making it his second fight on U.S. soil. In another thrilling contest that many called the fight of the year, he pulled out a close majority decision victory, with scores of 116-112, 117-111 and 114-114. The punch stats showed how close the fight was, as Frampton connected on 242 out of 668 punches for an accuracy rate of 36 percent, while Santa Cruz landed 255 out of his 1,002 punches for 25-percent accuracy. With his victory, he ended 2016 as the Fighter of the Year according to The Ring, ESPN and the Boxing Writers Association of America.\nFor such a close fight, a rematch was inevitable. This time around, the result was the opposite, as Santa Cruz scored a win by majority decision, throwing and landing far more punches throughout the contest. The final margin was razor thin, with Santa Cruz winning 115-113, 115-113 and 114-114.",

  "description": "Born on December 22, 1990 in Nogales, Sonora, Oscar Valdez embodies the Mexican fighting style with his aggressiveness, as he continually comes forward and drills his opponents with sharp combinations. He had a solid amateur career, as he qualified for the 2008 Olympics when he was only 17. He didn\u2019t medal, although he had the misfortune of facing the eventual gold medalist in his first match. In the 2008 AIBA Youth World Boxing Championships, he took gold. He also claimed the gold medal at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. Competing in the Olympics again in 2012, he had more success, winning two matches, but still failed to medal.\nValdez decided to turn pro after that and had his first fight on November 3, 2012 against Angel Prado. It took him only two rounds to win the fight by TKO, as he showed off his considerable punching power. He fought again just over a month later, and the result was the same, a second-round TKO victory over Corben Page. After a couple months off, he fought on March 16, 2013 against Carlos Gonzalez, picking up a fourth-round TKO.\nWith the young boxer\u2019s aggressive fighting style, high pace, and heavy hands, it made sense why Oscar Valdez put so many opponents away. His first nine fights were TKO victories, which earned him a shot at the NABF Junior super featherweight title on April 12, 2014 against the 10-4-1 Adrian Perez. He didn\u2019t get the TKO this time \u2013 it was a KO, instead, as he showed off his knack for body shots with an excellent left hand dug right into the liver, and a right hand after it to seal the deal. Perez dropped to the ground, and although he was conscious, he was too badly hurt to even attempt to get up.\nAfter one title defense which was another victory inside the distance, Valdez fought for the NABF Junior featherweight belt on July 26, 2014. He fought Juan Ruiz, who became the first boxer to take him to a decision. Oscar Valdez still won all eight rounds, though. He picked up where he left off after that, knocking out three more fighters and then winning a 10-round unanimous decision over Ruben Tamayo. With another two TKOs, he had built his record up to 18-0, and for that he got a chance to fight for the WBO-NABO featherweight title on April 9, 2016 against Evgeny Gradovich, who was 21-1-1 at the time. In a brutal beatdown, Valdez took control from the very beginning on his way to a fourth-round TKO.\nWith that win, he got his first shot at a world title, the WBO featherweight belt on July 23, 2016 against the 26-0 Matias Rueda. He used terrific body work to score two knockdowns in the first two rounds, and on the second, the referee waved off the fight. In the biggest fight of his life and against an undefeated opponent, Valdez showed his tremendous talent and finishing ability. He closed out 2016 with another TKO, this one in the seventh round against Hiroshige Osawa to defend his belt.",

  "description": "Born on January 26, 1991 in Toledo, Ohio, Robert Easter Jr. came from a boxing family. His grandfather taught his father, uncles, and aunt the sport, and he was boxing as a young child. He put together an extremely impressive amateur career, although he never managed to win a national title, typically reaching either the semis of the finals before losing. Still, he finished his amateur career with a record of 213-17 and was an alternate for the 2012 U.S. Olympic Boxing team. After receiving a training camp invitation from Adrien Broner, he decided to turn pro.\nEaster had his first professional fight on November 10, 2012 against Eddie Corona, and his power was apparent from the get-go as he picked up a TKO win in the second round. He followed that up less than a month later with a first-round KO over David Castillo. Although he won his fight against Jose Valderrama on February 16, 2013 by stoppage after the first round, he wasn\u2019t happy with his performance, as he felt like he was trying too hard to get the knockout.\nDespite his own criticisms, the rangy Easter was an excellent prospect, as he had a slick style honed by his hundreds of amateur fights, along with the power to put opponents away. His sixth fight against the 11-8-1 Lowell Brownfield was his first fight against an opponent with a winning record, but it didn\u2019t make a difference, as he scored a sharp second-round KO. By the end of 2013, Robert Easter Jr. had built up an 8-0 record with every win coming by stoppage and none of them going past the third round.\nHis first two fights of 2014 was also his first two fights to see the scorecards, and even though he didn\u2019t get the finish either time, he did win two clear-cut unanimous decisions after eight rounds. He followed that up with a first-round KO of Roberto Acevedo on September 6, 2014, and then had his longest fight to date when he beat Angel Hernandez by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.\nAlthough his level of competition got higher, Robert Easter Jr. was improving along with it, and he had a dominant 2015. He fought four times that year and won each fight by either KO or TKO, including two finishes in the second round. His string of excellent performances and perfect 16-0 record earned him his first big fight on April 1, 2016, when he took on the 23-3-1 Argenis Mendez, who had been the IBF super featherweight champion. Easter showed that he could get the finish against a skilled veteran, as he battered his opponent on the way to a fifth-round TKO.\nOn September 9, 2016, he had his first title fight, for the IBF lightweight belt against the 24-0 Richard Commey. It was a close fight with two high-level fighters going at it, but this time around, Easter was the one who walked away with the title. He won by split decision after 12 rounds. He followed that up with a unanimous decision over Luis Cruz.",

  "description": "Born on June 11, 1989 in Manchester, England, Terry Flanagan is a skilled southpaw who started boxing at 7 years old. Since he was small for his age and fought up in weight quite often, he had an unspectacular amateur career. He won about as many as he lost, and didn\u2019t pick up any tournament medals. Feeling like his style was better suited for the longer rounds of professional fighting, he made the leap to the professional ranks when he was 19.\nFlanagan had his pro debut on January 24, 2009 in a six-round fight against Danny McDermid. He cruised to an easy win on points. He ended up winning his first four fights on the scorecards, before picking up his first finish to close out 2009 when he beat Delroy Spencer by TKO in the third round. He followed that up with a first-round KO over Csaba Toth and a second-round TKO over Ignac Kassai.\nWhile Terry Flanagan demonstrated solid technical skills and decent punching power over the early portion of his career, he was fighting a low level of competition, which is common for young British fighters. Still, he was staying active and getting the job done. After he had built up a perfect 13-0 record, he got a chance to fight Dougie Curran for the English super featherweight title on May 18, 2012. It was definitely a fight he was supposed to win, as Curran was 5-11-2 at the time and had already lost to him once before. Flanagan took care of business with a unanimous decision win after 10 rounds. He defended the title against Troy James a few months later.\nHe then decided to give the Prizefighter lightweight tournament a try. He fought three times on October 6, 2012, just weeks after his fight against James, but he managed to win three straight fights by decision to win the tournament. After keeping his win streak going and his undefeated record intact, he fought Martin Gethin on July 26, 2014 for the British lightweight title. He dished out a beating, and Gethin didn\u2019t come out after the seventh round.\nAfter taking out Danny Little by fifth-round TKO, Terry Flanagan took on Stephen Ormond for the WBO European lightweight title. He was ahead on all the scorecards when his opponent was disqualified for repeated headbutts.\nIn his next fight on July 11, 2015, he got his first shot at a world title when he took on Jose Zepeda for the WBO lightweight belt. It was a bit unlucky for his Zepeda, who dislocated his shoulder and couldn\u2019t come out after the second round.\nFlanagan made his first defense of his new title in Manchester against Diego Magdaleno, and he put on a show for his hometown fans, blasting his opponent and winning in the second round by TKO. He followed that up with two unanimous decision victories after 12 rounds. In his last fight of 2016, he dominated Orlando Cruz on the way to an eighth-round TKO win, taking his record to 32-0 in the process.",

  "description": "Gervonta Davis is a professional boxer who was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on November 7, 1994. Avoiding the dangerous streets is crucial for young kids in Baltimore when they are not in school, so Davis\u2019 family allowed him to spend his free time at a local boxing gym. His training started at the age of five at the Upton Boxing Center, which was owned and operated by local celebrity Calvin Ford. The HBO show \u201cThe Wire\u201d based the character Dennis Wise on Ford.\nThe great training helped Gervonta Davis have an accomplished amateur boxing career. He won his first National Silver Gloves Championship in 2006 at the age of 12. He also won the tournament in 2007 and 2008. Davis added two gold medals at the Junior Olympics during this time too. Davis went through a minor adjustment period when he started facing older boxers, but he returned to prominence when he won the National Gold Gloves Championship in 2012.\nAfter finishing his amateur career with a 206-15 record, Gervonta Davis made his professional debut on February 22, 2013. The match against Desi Williams was scheduled to go four rounds, but Williams was knocked out less than two minutes into the first round. Davis fought a total of six matches in 2013, and he easily won every fight with a knockout. He had his first competitive professional fight when he took on German Meraz on October 8, 2014. While Davis was forced to box six rounds for the first time in his career, he still came away with the unanimous decision victory.\nThe win over Meraz set up a match against extremely accomplished Puerto Rican boxer Israel Suarez on February 20, 2015. Suarez entered the fight with an impressive resume, but Gervonta Davis knocked him out after only 47 seconds in the first round. Gervonta got another quick first round knockout in his next fight against Alberto Mora on May 22, 2015. Suarez and Mora were both knocked out for the first time in their career.\nThe impressive string of knockout victories gave Davis the opportunity to fight for a large audience on television for the first time in his career. His fight against Recky Dulay was on the undercard of the pay-per-view event showcasing the match between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Andre Berto on September 12, 2015. Dulay entered the match with an impressive 8-1 record, but he was also knocked out in the first round.\nGervonta got the chance to fight a former world title holder for the first time when he faced Cristobal Cruz on October 30, 2015. Cruz was clearly entering the end of his career, so he did not put up much of a threat before losing by technical knockout in the third round. Davis won 15 of his first 16 professional fights by knockout before getting his first world title shot on January 14, 2017. The match was for Jose Pedraza\u2019s IBF junior lightweight title. Both boxers entered the match undefeated, but the champion ultimately got dethroned by technical knockout in the seventh round.",

  "description": "A skilled fighter who has won both amateur and professional titles, Luke Campbell was born on September 27, 1987 in Hull, East Yorkshire, England. A soft-spoken southpaw who is known for sharp counterpunching, he has boxing in his genes, as his grandfather was an Irish champion.\nCampbell began his training when he set foot in St. Paul\u2019s Amateur Boxing Club at 13 years of age. His first major achievement was winning the English senior ABA bantamweight title in 2007, which he repeated in 2008. He took gold as a bantamweight at the 2008 European Amateur Boxing Championships, and followed that up with a bronze medal at the 2009 EU Championships. After collecting a silver medal at the 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships, he earned a chance to compete at the 2012 Olympics. While he had close matches in the quarters, semis and the finals, he won them all to take the gold medal.\nHe turned pro on July 13, 2013 when he fought Andy Harris in Hull, in front of his hometown fans. He scored a dominant first-round TKO victory. His next fight was against Neil Hepper in October, and this time it was a first-round KO. Less than a month later he was fighting again and scoring another finish, this time in the fifth round against Lee Connelly.\nChuck Jones became the first fighter to take Campbell to a decision, but the slick southpaw won on points after four rounds. He then stopped Scott Moises in the eighth round, making him the first man to ever accomplish that.\nLuke Campbell said he needed to take time off from boxing in April of 2014 because his father had cancer. However, he ended up fighting another four times that year, earning one decision win and three stoppages, which ran his record to 9-0.\nAfter two more excellent TKO victories, he got his first title fight. He fought Tommy Coyle on August 1, 2015 in Hull for the WBC international lightweight title. In a beautiful performance, he knocked Coyle down multiple times throughout the contest before scoring a TKO in the 10th round to take the belt.\nHowever, Campbell would end up losing that belt in his very next fight against Yvan Mendy. In a poor defensive performance, he got dropped for the first time in his career and ended up losing a close split decision.\nHe got right back into action three months later against Gary Sykes, and won the Commonwealth lightweight title by way of second-round TKO. His next fight was against Argenis Mendez for the WBC Silver lightweight title. Despite a defensive lapse in the second round that resulted in him getting dropped, he took over the rest of the fight and cruised to a unanimous decision win.\nLuke Campbell showed off his power in his next performance, as he took out Derry Mathews with a vicious KO in the fourth round. He raised the bar even higher for his next fight, as he dropped Jairo Lopez in round one, and then finished him with a crushing uppercut in round two.",

  "description": "Felix Verdejo is a professional boxer who was born on May 19, 1993. He spent most of his childhood living in a home in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with his two sisters and two brothers. Felix became the first person in the family to pick up the sport of boxing when he began training at a local gym at the age of nine.\nAfter training for more than 10 years, Verdejo finally started entering national boxing tournaments in 2012. Winning the 2012 American Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament in Rio de Janeiro ensured that he would be a member of the Puerto Rican Olympic boxing team. Verdejo defeated Panama\u2019s Jose Huertas and Tunisia\u2019s Ahmed Mejri in the first two rounds of the 2012 Olympic Games in London before losing to Ukraine\u2019s Vasyl Lomenchenko in the quarterfinal round.\nThe solid showing at the Olympics convinced Felix Verdejo that he should start his professional boxing career. His first professional fight took place on December 6, 2012, at The Mirage in Las Vegas. Verdejo defeated Leonardo Chavez by unanimous decision. The first professional win was then followed up with five straight knockout victories. After winning his first nine matches, Verdejo got the chance to fight in one of the most historic arenas in the world. He secured a first round knockout victory over Lauro Alcantar in Madison Square Garden on January 15, 2014. Six months later, he had another first round knockout win over Engelberto Valenzuela in the same building.\nFelix Verdejo finally had his first fight get past the fourth round when he faced Oscar Bravo on August 16, 2014. While Verdejo was challenged for the first time in his career, he still walked away with a unanimous decision victory in the eight-round bout. He ended 2014 with knockout victories over Sergio Villanueva and Karim El Ouazghari to finish the year with a perfect 17-0 professional record. The impressive start to his career let Felix Verdejo fight Marco Antonio Lopez for the vacant WBO Latino lightweight title on April 25, 2015. Lopez struggled to land punches before getting knocked out in the fifth round.\nVerdejo successfully defended his new title for the first time when he got a unanimous decision victory over Ivan Najera on June 13, 2015. He finally got to box in front of his hometown fans of San Juan when he took on Josenilson Dos Santos at the Roberto Clemente Coliseum on December 11, 2015. Dos Santos struggled from the opening bell, and he was eventually knocked out late in the second round. The WBO Latino lightweight title was also successfully defended against William Silva, Jose Luis Rodriguez and Juan Jose Martinez before the end of 2016.\nFelix Verdejo\u2019s career looked like it could be in jeopardy when he got into a serious motorcycle accident in August 2016. The accident forced him to stay in the hospital for 12 days before fully recovering from a head injury. He returned to the ring for the first time after the accident on February 3, 2017, to defeat Oliver Flores by unanimous decision. ",

  "description": "Born on February 14, 1987 in Barry, Wales, Lee Selby was brought up in a boxing family. His father loved boxing and encouraged his three sons to pick up the sport, and although Lee started out with Tae Kwon Do, he soon made the transition to boxing. He had his first amateur fight when he was 10 years old, although he didn\u2019t win any major tournaments over the course of his amateur career.\nSelby experienced a personal tragedy the same year that he debuted as a professional. His older brother, Michael got drunk and fell over a bridge. He drowned and his body was found several days later. Lee started smoking and drinking heavily to cope with the pain, but eventually pulled himself together and decided he would fight hard for both himself and his late brother.\nHis professional debut came on July 12, 2008 against Sid Razak, and he picked up a win on points after six rounds. He would win his next three fights on points, as well. However, he hit a bump in the road on May 29, 2009, as he lost on points to Samir Mouneimne. He didn\u2019t let that stop him, though, and on August 10, 2009 he bounced back with a points win over Ian Bailey. He then scored two more wins on points, with the latter being an impressive victory over the 10-1-1 Ben Jones.\nFor that performance, Lee Selby got a shot at the British Welsh Area featherweight title on October 30, 2010 against Dai Davies. Even though it was a title fight, Davies wasn\u2019t a particularly impressive opponent, sporting a poor record of 6-13-1. To his credit, Lee scored the first stoppage victory of his career, winning by KO in the second round.\nSelby seemed to turn a corner after this victory. While he wasn\u2019t a power puncher, he started doing more damage in his fights and winning by stoppage more often instead of scraping by on points each time. At one point, he had a streak of four straight victories by TKO or KO, during which time he collected the British Celtic, British and Commonwealth featherweight titles.\nOn July 13, 2013, he fought the 16-0 Viorel Simion for the WBC International featherweight title. It was a competitive contest, but he pulled out a razor-thin unanimous decision to win the belt. After another unanimous decision win, this one over Ryan Walsh, he picked up the European featherweight title when he beat Rendall Munroe by TKO in the sixth round.\nAfter running his record to 20-1, Lee Selby earned a shot at a world title, in this case the IBF featherweight belt. The fight was on May 30, 2015 against Evgeny Gradovich, who was undefeated. He controlled the action up until the eighth round, when an accidental clash of heads resulted in a cut to Gradovich. The fight went to the scorecards, where Selby was declared the victor. He defended the title against Fernando Montiel a few months later and won by unanimous decision. In his post-fight interview, he dedicated the fight to a friend of his who had recently died from attempting to eat an entire burger in one bite.",

  "description": "Born on February 17, 1988 in Ukraine, Vasyl Lomachenko is an incredibly technically-sound southpaw who ranks among the most accomplished amateur boxers in history. He started training early in his life since his father was a boxing trainer. In the 2007 World Championships, he made it to the finals, but came away with the silver medal after losing to Albert Selimov. He would go on to beat Selimov twice to avenge the loss, which ended up being the only loss of his entire amateur career.\nLomachenko put on a show at the 2008 Olympics, dominating every bout to win gold and get the Val Barker Trophy for the most outstanding boxer in the tournament. He took gold at the next two World Championships in 2009 and 2011, and then brought home another gold medal at the 2012 Olympics. When he finished his amateur career, he had a stunning record of 396 victories and only that one loss.\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Vasyl Lomachenko decided to take the next step in his career. From January to May of 2013, he competed in the World Series of Boxing, which is technically still considered amateur competition, although it has rules similar to professional boxing. He won all six fights in that organization, and then had his official pro debut on October 12, 2013 against Jose Ramirez. While most fighters take on journeymen to start their careers, that wasn\u2019t the case for Lomachenko, whose amateur credentials resulted in fights against tough opponents from the beginning. He took out the 25-3 Ramirez in a beautiful performance, winning by TKO in the fourth round and getting the WBO International featherweight title in the process.\nHis next fight was fraught with controversy. He was aiming to make history by winning a world title, in this case the WBO featherweight title, in just his second fight. The record was held by Saensak Muangsurin, who did so in his third pro fight. His opponent, Orlando Salido, didn\u2019t make weight and had an 11-pound weight advantage on fight night. Throughout the fight, the referee did little as Salido connected on numerous low blows. Despite a late surge by Lomachenko, he wasn\u2019t aggressive enough through most of the bout and lost a majority decision.\nHe tied Muangsurin\u2019s record in his next fight, when he beat the 24-0 Gary Russell Jr on June 21, 2014 to win the WBO featherweight title. It was a difficult fight against a skilled opponent, but he managed to pull out a majority decision. In his next fight, he defeated Chonlatarn Piriyapinyo by unanimous decision after 12 rounds.\nVasyl Lomachenko defended his belt two more times, winning by knockout each time. On June 11, 2016, he jumped up to junior lightweight to take on Roman Martinez for the WBO title. His skills were far too much for Martinez to handle, as he dominated from the beginning, eventually picking up the win by KO in the fifth round. In his first title defense, Lomachenko had another spectacular performance as he beat down Nicholas Walters, who quit on his stool after the seventh round.",

  "description": "Born on May 18, 1986 in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, Liam Walsh is a southpaw fighter with solid technical skills, excellent cardio and the heart to keep going even during the toughest fights.\nWalsh didn\u2019t have the lengthy amateur career of many fighters, and he went pro a few months before his 22nd birthday. He first fought on February 2, 2008 on a card headlined by popular British boxer Amir Khan. His twin brother, Ryan, and his older brother, Michael, both also made their professional boxing debuts on the same card, and it was a good night for the family, as all three scored victories. Liam took on the 22-69-3 Daniel Thorpe and finished the fight early, dropping Thorpe with a right hand for a first-round KO.\nIn his next fight on June 14, 2008, he knocked his opponent out again, this time taking out Johnny Geaves in the fourth round. He followed that up with a victory on points after four rounds against Youssef Al Hamidi, and then went on a streak of five straight victories by way of TKO. While Liam Walsh was winning impressively, his opponents were anything but impressive, as all of them had losing records.\nOn September 24, 2010, he faced his first opponent with a winning record in the 8-5-2 Sebastien Cornu, whom he beat on points after six rounds. That set him up for a shot at the Commonwealth super featherweight title just under a month later against Maxwell Awuku, who had a record of 20-1-1. In a difficult, back-and-forth fight, he ended up winning by unanimous decision after 12 rounds.\nHe scored a 10th-round KO in his first title defense, but had a far tougher time in his second defense, which was against Paul Appleby. The two men went toe to toe, and Walsh got dropped in the seventh round. However, he fought back and ended up earning the stoppage after 10 rounds to keep his belt.\nAfter that gritty performance, he fought Domenico Urbano on July 14, 2012 for the WBO European lightweight title and took the belt home with a dominant TKO victory in the eighth round. He made multiple title defenses over 2013 and 2014, and then added the British super featherweight title to his collection with a 12-round unanimous decision victory over Gary Sykes on November 29, 2014.\nHe stopped Joe Murray by fifth-round TKO in a title defense at the 02 Arena, which was a strong showing in a rematch of a close fight that Liam Walsh won by majority decision. On July 11, 2015, Walsh fought Isaias Santos Sampaio for the WBO Inter-Continental lightweight title and had another great performance, knocking out his opponent in the sixth round. He went back to super featherweight to defend his belts against Troy James, and notched another stoppage victory, this one a TKO in the eighth round. He kept his undefeated record alive when he fought Andrey Klimov on October 8, 2016, winning a unanimous decision after 12 rounds and bringing his record to 21-0 in the process.",

  "description": "Born on August 22, 1985 in Barinas, Venezuela, Jorge Linares came from humble beginnings, as he lived in a small town and his family didn\u2019t have much. While he was also good at running and volleyball, his father told him that he should stick with boxing. As an amateur, he won gold at two tournaments in 1999, Venezuela\u2019s Juniors National Championship and Juniors Venezuela Panama Dual. He won the silver medal the next year at the National Championship, and then won gold again at the Juniors National Championship in 2001. By the time he finished his amateur career, he had an excellent record of 89-5.\nGetting the opportunity to box professionally over in Japan, Linares snatched it up and began his career at just 17 years old on December 15, 2002. He fought Kyong-Soo Chung and won by KO in the first round. Fighting on small shows around Japan and taking on journeyman fighters, he took his record to 7-0 before he got a chance to fight for the WBA Fedelatin super bantamweight title in his home country. It took place on January 31, 2004 against Hugo Rafael Soto, and he ended up winning by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.\nHis next three fighters were in Tokyo, as he picked up a unanimous decision over Michael Domingo, a unanimous decision over Renan Acosta to win the WBA Fedelatin featherweight title, and a first-round KO over Sung-Hoon Park. After three more stoppage victories, he beat Jean Javier Sotelo on May 26, 2005 to pick up the WBA Fedecentro featherweight title.\nJorge Linares was showing improvements in his technique every time he stepped into the ring, and after building a 23-0 record, he got his first shot at a world title. It came against Oscar Larios on July 21, 2007, and with a 10th-round TKO he won the WBC featherweight title.\nAfter defending that belt once, he made the move to super featherweight, where he won the WBA title with a fifth-round TKO over Whyber Garcia. He defended this belt once before suffering a huge upset when he was beaten by first-round TKO against Juan Carlos Salgado.\nLinares took some time off and rebounded on March 27, 2010 with a majority decision win over Francisco Lorenzo. A four-fight winning streak earned him a shot at the WBC lightweight title, but despite a strong performance in that fight against Antonio DeMarco, he was stopped in the 11th-round because of a bad cut on his nose. In his next fight, he was stopped again, this time by Sergio Thompson by way of second-round TKO.\nWith consecutive losses for the first time in his career, Jorge Linares took just over six months off and came back on October 7, 2012 to beat Hector Velazquez by unanimous decision. He won six fights in a row to get another shot at the WBC lightweight title, and this time he came through with a fourth-round KO over Javier Prieto. After two title defenses, Linares then beat Anthony Croalla by unanimous decision to win the WBA and The Ring lightweight titles.",

  "description": "One of the most accomplished boxers of all time, Manny Pacquiao won titles in multiple weight divisions and earned the title \u201cFighter of the Decade\u201d in the 2000s. He collected several fighter of the year awards, was part of a record-breaking pay-per-view, and between all of that he also had time to record music and work as a politician in the Philippines.\nWhat may be most impressive about all that was Pacquiao\u2019s humble beginnings. Born on December 17, 1978 in Kibawe, Bukidnon, Philippines, he grew up very poor and left home when he was just 14. Living on the streets, he eventually got free room and board when he made the Philippine national amateur boxing team. He built up an amateur record of 60-4, but decided to turn professional after the death of a friend of his. Weighing only 98 pounds, he needed to put rocks in his pocket just so he could weigh in high enough to fight in the minimumweight division. He made his debut on January 22, 1995 and defeated Edmun Enting Ignacio by unanimous decision after four rounds.\nFighting in the Philippines, he quickly became a fan favorite because of his aggressive, high-octane fighting style. That did get him into trouble in his 12th fight, as he was knocked out by Rustico Torrecampo in the third round. One thing about Manny Pacquiao, though, is that he always had mental toughness and didn\u2019t let defeat get him down. He came back less than three months later and got back to his winning ways, putting together another long streak of victories.\nOn June 26, 1997 he won his first belt, the OPBF flyweight title with a fifth-round KO against Chokchai Chockvivat. Four fights later, he took on Chatchai Sasakul and won the WBC and lineal flyweight titles. Although he lost his lineal flyweight title by third-round TKO against Medgoen Singsurat, he got another title shot in his next fight, this one for the WBC International super bantamweight title, and he knocked out Reynante Jamili in the second round.\nAfter building up an impressive record of 37-2-1, Pacquiao had one of his most impressive performances when he fought Marco Antonio Barrera for The Ring and lineal featherweight titles on November 15, 2003. In a stunning performance, he showed that he still had his trademark punching power at a higher weight class, as he stopped Barrera by TKO in the 11th round.\nHis next fight was against the man who would become his biggest rival, Juan Manuel Marquez. In a classic battle, he came out strong and knocked Marquez down three times in the very first round. However, the Mexican fighter rallied and utilized his excellent counterpunching skills. At the end of 12 rounds, the fight was ruled a draw.\nAfter a fourth-round TKO victory in his next fight, he took on another skilled Mexican fighter in Erik Morales, who defeated him by unanimous decision after 12 rounds of action. He returned to defeat Hector Velazquez by sixth round TKO to set up a rematch with Morales, and this time he emerged the victor, battering Morales on his way to 10th-round TKO.\nThe two fought their rubber match on November 18, 2006, and he performed even better this time around, knocking out Morales in round three. With another two impressive victories, he got another shot at Marquez on March 15, 2008. This fight was for the WBC, The Ring and lineal super featherweight titles. In another close and controversial fight, the Filipino boxer prevailed by split decision. In his next fight, he went up to lightweight and won the WBC title with a ninth-round TKO over David Diaz.\nManny Pacquiao had improved significantly as a fighter, particularly since he started training with Freddie Roach. The veteran trainer sharpened up his punches, in particular his right hook, which the trainer called \u201cManila Ice.\u201d He was becoming more of a boxer-puncher than a swarmer, and in his next two fights, he would emerge as a true superstar.\nFirst, he took on Oscar De La Hoya. In one of the most impressive performances of his career, he dismantled the Mexican legend from start to finish, landing punches from seemingly every angle until a corner stoppage in round eight. He followed that up with an absolutely brutal KO over the tough British fighter Ricky Hatton, who he put to sleep with a picture-perfect left hand in the second round, winning the IBO, The Ring and lineal light welterweight titles in the process.\nHe continued his dominance across different weight classes by winning the WBO welterweight title when he defeated Miguel Cotto on November 14, 2009. After a title defense against Joshua Clottey, he went up to super welterweight and won the WBC belt with a 12-round unanimous decision over Antonio Margarito. He defended the title twice \u2013 first against Shane Mosley, and then in a fight against his old rival Marquez on November 12, 2011. The fight against Marquez was once again very close, and he pulled out a majority decision in a bout some feel he had lost.\nHe was upset by Timothy Bradley on June 9, 2012, losing a split decision that most thought he had won. He then had a fourth fight against Marquez, and in a violent, back-and-forth fight, the Mexican fighter finally emerged victorious when he brutally knocked Pacquiao out in the sixth round.\nAfter some time off, he came back on November 24, 2013 to defeat Brandon Rios, and then got revenge against Bradley with a 12-round unanimous decision win. Another decision victory against Chris Algieri set up a super fight with one of the all-time greats in Floyd Mayweather Jr.\nThe fight between the two boxing legends destroyed the pay-per-view record with 4.6-million buys, earning Pacquiao well over $100 million. However, the fight itself turned out to be slow and resulted in many disappointed viewers. The Filipino fighter didn\u2019t have much luck catching Mayweather save a few bursts of action here and there, and he ended up on the losing end of a unanimous decision. He would bounce back by beating Bradley again by unanimous decision in their rubber match.",

  "description": "Born on November 23, 1988 in Clearwater, Florida, Keith Thurman is known for his vicious punching power and his flamboyant personality. He has boxed for most of his life, first trained by Benjamin Getty, who was known for his work with the legendary boxer Sugar Ray Leonard. Thurman first fought as an amateur in 1997, and he would go on to have a distinguished career, winning 101 times and scoring a KO in 76 bouts, which is an extremely high knockout percentage for amateur boxing. He earned six national championships before deciding to turn pro shortly before his 19th birthday.\nHe showed off his punching ability in his very first fight, destroying Kensky Rodney for a first-round TKO. That was no fluke, either, as he won his first eight fights in the first round by either KO or TKO. His ninth fight also ended in the first round, but in a no contest because of an accidental head clash that left both fighters unable to keep going.\nKeith Thurman would bounce back from that unfortunate result less than three months later when he defeated Marteze Logan by third-round TKO. He followed that up with a second-round TKO over Travis Hartman. On November 6, 2009, he demonstrated his ability to go the distance for the first time, easily defeating Edvan Dos Santos Barros by unanimous decision after eight rounds.\nIn the early part of his career, Thurman may not have been facing the best opponents, but he was developing well. His power was apparent in every fight, but he was also learning how to use it better. He was becoming a sharper technician instead of just a powerful brawler who overwhelmed opponents with sheer ferocity.\nAfter that decision win, he put together a streak of seven straight finishes to earn a shot at the WBO-NABO junior middleweight title. It was on November 24, 2012 against Carlos Quintana, and he put on quite the show. He battered the veteran fighter over four rounds to earn a TKO victory. Quintana was so badly beaten that he chose to retire after the bout.\nNext, Keith Thurman added the WBO Inter-Continental welterweight title to his collection with a 12-round unanimous decision over Jan Zaveck. His next fight, on July 27, 2013, was for the WBA interim welterweight title. In his first chance at a world title, he showed an impressive amount of heart in a grueling, back-and-forth fight. While the two fighters traded heavy leather, Thurman eventually wore down his opponent, scoring a knockdown in the ninth and then finishing the fight by KO in the 10th round.\nHe made multiple defenses of his WBA title, which the organization eventually elevated to the full belt instead of just the interim belt. On March 4, 2017, he took on the 33-0 Danny Garcia in a match to unify the WBA and WBC welterweight titles. In his closest fight to that point, he controlled the action just enough to earn a split decision after 12 rounds, with the judges\u2019 scorecards reading 116-112, 115-113 and 113-115, bringing his record to 28-0 (1) in the process.",

  "description": "Born to parents of Pakistani origin in Bolton, England, just near Manchester, Amir Khan exhibited a love for a wide range of sports, from cricket and basketball to football (soccer). He also became involved in boxing at an early age. His father introduced him to a gym at the ripe age of eight, and it would not take him long to begin taking it relatively seriously. By 11 years of age, he had begun to compete at school and on the junior circuit. \nAlthough it was still early days, he quickly made his mark first at the Bolton Boxing Club and later at the Bury Boxing Club. This time spent under coach Mick Jelly would set a foundation for his wins as a schoolboy and three junior ABA championships. Gold medals in both the 2003 Junior Olympics and the European Student Championships soon followed\u2013and all this by the tender age of 16. Despite adding a few more significant wins at the junior level, the fighter already had bigger goals in sight.\nIt was the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens that had captured his imagination as the capstone of a successful amateur career. The first obstacle, though, was to perform as well as possible in the qualifiers in Bulgaria. He placed first and went on to represent Britain in the 2004 games. The gold medal remained just out of his grasp, leaving him with a silver medal after a loss to Mario Kindelan in the final round. The young fighter got the chance to make this up to himself shortly thereafter by winning a three-round decision against Kindelan. But, again, Khan had bigger challenges on his mind at this point\u2014with an amateur record of 101-9, he geared up for his professional debut.\nEarly on, fellow fighters and fans alike watched in awe as \u201cKing Khan\u201d demonstrated amazing hand speed. Keeping out of opponents\u2019 range, this up-and-comer, known to be a fast starter, would often overwhelm and weaken opponents with staggering combinations to both the head and the body. In due time, fighters like Zab Judah, Paulie Malinaggi, Marcos Maidana, and Dmitry Salita would learn this all too well.\nWhile these strengths swept Amir to several wins in the lightweight division, Breidis Prescott seemed to have his number. Prescott defeated the \u201cKing\u201d in 55 seconds with a clean jab followed by a combination of hooks. A number of commentators lamented Amir\u2019s lack of a convincing answer to Prescott\u2019s left hook and subsequent combinations.\nUndeterred by this defeat (and criticisms that he had a weak chin), Amir turned to trainer Freddie Roach and went on to win the WBA International lightweight title after Oisin Fagan\u2019s corner threw in the towel after just two rounds. This made Amir one of the youngest British boxers to win a championship belt. It is unclear whether or not sparring with Manny Pacquiao during this time made a difference, but it most likely did not hurt. After a win by a technical decision over Marco Antonio Barrera due to a cut, Amir retained the WBA belt and picked up the WBO Intercontinental lightweight title.\nEffectively at the top of the lightweight division, the \u201cKing\u201d decided to make the move to light welterweight. Within the year, the previously dominant lightweight would dispatch with Andreas Kotelnik by decision for the title, and Dmitry Salita by TKO in only 76 seconds. \nNext, Amir effectively slogged through much longer battles with Malignaggi and Maidana, which the fighters saw through to the 11th and 12th rounds, respectively. The press went wild over the Maidana bout, which was declared the fight of the year, and the Brit received plaudits for his show of heart in the fight.\nThe champion continued this show of heart throughout his next few fights, but even heart has its limits. Lamont Peterson was able to cut the distance and deliver significant blows to Amir, highlighting previous criticisms that Amir could not handle himself inside the pocket. Peterson won by split decision, even though many cast doubt on the two-point deduction for pushing levied against Khan. Peterson later tested positive for PEDs, meaning the title reverted back to Amir. But, Danny Garcia stopped this streak through the lightweight division with a TKO. Amir soon made amends with a 10th-round TKO of Carlos Molina for the Silver Light welterweight title. By that time, though, he had already shifted his sights to the welterweight division.\nIn 2013 and 2014, Amir decided to test himself in the welterweight division. After a win in what was technically a catch-weight bout against Julio Diaz, Amir claimed the WBA International welterweight title, defeating Luis Collazo by unanimous decision. Many considered this a return to the skills that he had used in the memorable performances from earlier in his career. Wins over Devon Alexander and Chris Aligieri led Amir to bulk up and compete in the middleweight division. However, Canelo Alvarez, arguably one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in the world, knocked Amir out in the 6th round, shutting down hopes that entrance into the middleweight division would start out with a victory.\nThroughout his career, Amir has attracted attention due to his often flamboyant lifestyle outside of the ring. He also does not mind speaking his mind while promoting fights, usually with phrases peppered with colorful language. An occasionally turbulent family life has also captured the attention of the media. His emotional approach to fights can be a double-edged sword; in some fights, this passion translates into energy and focus, but in others it seems to distract him and make him reckless.\nThis combination of explosive, fast-paced action in the ring and a larger-than-life persona in the media has turned some people off; others, though, only love him more for his antics. Love him or hate him, Amir Khan has built up a career and a public persona that have captivated the boxing world. ",

  "description": "Born on October 27, 1987 in Akron, Ohio, Shawn Porter was always athletic, as he played football growing up while putting together a spectacular amateur boxing career. Playing high school football, he achieved all-conference honors for his junior and senior years. Shortly after high school, he won the 2007 World Golden Gloves Championship. He defeated quite a few future professional fighters during his amateur career, but couldn\u2019t quite qualify for the 2008 U.S. Olympic boxing team. He decided to turn pro instead, after amassing 276 wins compared to only 14 losses as an amateur.\nPorter made his pro debut at middleweight on October 3, 2008, and it ended quickly, as he took out Norman Johnson by first-round TKO. Less than a month later, he ended his fight against Toris Smith the same way. He would win his first four fights by stoppage before going four rounds against Cory Jones and picking up a unanimous decision.\nAfter building up a 9-0 record, Shawn Porter dropped down to junior middleweight on August 29, 2009. His first fight at his new weight class was against Lamar Harris, and he put together a sharp performance, taking Harris out by TKO in the very first round. With another two victories, he earned a shot at the WBO-NABO interim junior middleweight title on February 19, 2010 against Russell Jordan. He cruised to a unanimous decision win after 10 rounds of action. To follow up his championship-winning performance, he took out Raul Pinzon by KO in the first round, Robert Kliewer by a fifth-round TKO, and Ray Robinson by a unanimous decision after 10 rounds.\nNext up, Porter decided to drop to a new weight class again, this time to welterweight to take on Hector Munoz for the NABF welterweight title. He battered Munoz, cutting him badly early in the contest, and went on to win by TKO in the ninth round. On July 28, 2012, he added the WBO-NABO welterweight title to his growing collection of belts when he beat Alfonso Gomez by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.\nHis next fight was his most difficult to that point in his career, as he fought a grueling 10 rounds against the tough, veteran Mexican fighter Julio Diaz. The result was a split draw. He bounced back with a unanimous decision victory over Phil Lo Greco, and then got revenge on Diaz by beating him by unanimous decision, picking up the IBF North American welterweight title in the process.\nShawn Porter became the IBF welterweight champion with an impressive unanimous decision win over Devon Alexander, and followed that up with an even more impressive title defense, stopping Paulie Malignaggi in the fourth round by TKO. On August 16, 2014, he lost his IBF title to Kell Brook by majority decision in a close fight. He bounced back from the first loss of his career with a fifth-round KO of Erick Bone and a 12-round unanimous decision over Adrien Broner. On June 25, 2016, Porter had another close defeat, this one coming by unanimous decision against Keith Thurman.",

  "description": "A dangerous southpaw who had success as an amateur and stepped his game up even further after turning pro, Errol Spence Jr has that rare combination of natural physical talent, technical skills and a strong work ethic. Born on March 3, 1990 in Brentwood, New York, Spence started training at a boxing gym as a 15-year-old living in Texas. He didn\u2019t want to stick with it, but his father encouraged him not to quit, and even switched to the graveyard shift so he\u2019d be able to drive his son to the gym during the day.\nBy 2009, Spence Jr had become the best amateur welterweight in the nation, as he won the U.S. National Championship at the Olympic Training Center. He followed that up with two more wins in 2010 and 2011, on his way to the 2012 Olympics in London. He ended up reaching the quarterfinals before losing to Andrey Zamkovoy, and then decided to start his professional career.\nHe demonstrated his power from the very beginning, knocking out his first opponent, Jonathan Garcia, in three rounds. Two TKOs followed before he recorded his first unanimous decision win in his four-round fight against Luis Torres.\nAs most young professional boxers do, Spence faced quite a few lesser opponents in the early stages of his career. However, he also demonstrated sharp boxing skills, able to attack from a variety of different angles and land power punches without compromising his own defense. He\u2019s definitely a knockout artist, but he\u2019s not a brawler who simply gets by on his power or \u201ctakes one to give one.\u201d He typically takes very few and gives quite a bit more, eventually resulting in either a TKO or a KO.\nErrol Spence Jr continued to collect finishes for the majority of his fights over the first two years of his career, and he got to announce himself in a big way when he fought Francisco Javier Castro at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on December 13, 2014. In a one-sided beat down, he scored a fifth-round TKO. He then had a step up in competition when he fought Samuel Vargas, who he put down in four rounds.\nAfter two more dominant TKO victories, he got a chance to fight in front of his hometown fans when he took on Alejandro Barrera at the Bomb Factory in Dallas, Texas. He put on another spectacular show, winning the first four rounds and then picking up a TKO in round five.\nHis next fight was even more impressive because of the level of completion. He faced off against Chris Algieri, who had a record of 21-2 at the time, but had only lost to top-level fighters in Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan. Algieri took both of those fighters 12 rounds and lost on the scorecards. He didn\u2019t get that far this time around. Spence completely battered Algieri, finishing him off with a left hook for a fifth-round TKO. A few months later, on August 21, 2016, he followed up with a six-round KO over Leonard Bundu.",

  "description": "Born on December 15, 1987 in Ventura, California, Mikey Garcia is a hard-hitting boxer whose father trained Fernando Vargas. He started training early on and had a successful amateur career, starting with a bronze medal at the 2001 Junior Golden Gloves. He would go on to win gold in 2004.\nGarcia made the jump to being a professional boxer on July 14, 2006 when he took on Domingo Herrera Mendoza. He cruised to a unanimous decision victory after four rounds. He showed off his power after that, knocking out Andrew Gannigan in the first round and Mario Franco in the second. His first match against an opponent who had won a fight was against Baladan Trevizo, who he knocked out in the first round.\nHe ended up putting together a streak of eight consecutive wins by KO or TKO, with none of those fights even going past the third round. Mikey Garcia wasn\u2019t facing tough competition at the time, but he was getting the job done in dominant fashion and staying active.\nIt took him several years of taking out lesser competition before he got his first shot at a title. He had built up a record of 20-0, with the majority of those wins coming by stoppage. On April 3, 2010, he fought Tomas Villa for the USBA featherweight title, and he didn\u2019t waste any time, winning the fight by TKO in the first round.\nHe followed that up with an eight-round unanimous decision victory over Pedro Navarrete. Next, he took out Cornelius Lock by TKO in the 11th round, and then defeated Olivier Lontchi by KO in the fifth round. That set him up for a shot at the NABF and WBO-NABO featherweight titles on March 26, 2011. He was 24-0 and taking on Matt Remillard, who was also undefeated at 23-0. Despite Remillard\u2019s impressive record, he was no match for Garcia, who stopped him after 10 rounds.\nMikey Garcia was making a name for himself as a prospect on the rise, as he combined considerable punching power with technical skill, and he could even switch hit, going southpaw to open up new angles. He took a big step up in competition on January 19, 2013 when he fought Orlando Salido for the WBO and The Ring featherweight titles. He was clearly controlling the fight when he broke his nose because of an accidental head clash in the ninth round. It went to the scorecards, where he won a technical decision.\nWhile Garcia stopped Juan Manuel Lopez in four rounds, he didn\u2019t make weight and was stripped of his WBO title. He went up to junior lightweight and won the WBO title with a beautiful KO of Roman Martinez on November 9, 2013. After defending that belt once, he got in a contract dispute which kept him out of action for two-and-a-half years. He came back on July 30, 2016 and showed no signs of ring rust, stopping Elio Rojas by TKO in the fifth round. On January 28, 2017, he became a three-division champion when he won the WBC lightweight belt with a third-round KO of Dejan Zlaticanin.",

  "description": "Jermell Charlo is a professional boxer who was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, on May 19, 1990. He has an identical twin brother named Jermall who is also a professional boxer. The twins began training in a local gym ran by their father at the age of 13. Since Jermell had boxing in his blood, it was no surprise that he quickly became one of the best amateur fighters in his weight class. He ended up winning the bronze medal at the 2005 National Junior Olympic Games despite only boxing for two years. \nJermell Charlo did not have much interest in an extended amateur career, so he made his professional boxing debut on December 8, 2007. The 17-year old easily got a unanimous decision victory over Corey Sommerville. Charlo went on to win his next six fights before boxing in his first match scheduled for eight rounds. The match took place on June 26, 2009, against Federico Flores Jr. Charlo had the first tough fight of his young career, but he still pulled out a victory with a technical knockout in the eighth round.\nCharlo followed up the win over Flores with eight straight easy victories to end 2011 with a perfect professional record of 16-0. While he had won less than half of his fights via knockout, Jermell showed off his power in his first fight of 2012. He instantly knocked out Chris Chatman with the first punch landed to start the third round. Charlo also had victories over Denis Douglin and Dashon Johnson in 2012. \nStarting his career with 19th straight victories awarded Jermell Charlo the opportunity to fight Harry Joe Yorgey on January 26, 2013, for the vacant WBC Continental Americas light middleweight title. Yorgey put up a good fight, but he was ultimately knocked out in the eighth round. Charlo added another title to his resume six months later. He beat Demetrius Hopkins by unanimous decision to win the USBA light middleweight title. This was also the first time that he had to box a full 12 rounds. Both titles were vacated before they were defended. \nJermell Charlo got easy victories over Jose Angel Rodriguez, Gabriel Rosado, Charlie Ota and Miguel Alberto Lozano to end 2014 with a perfect record in his first 25 professional boxing matches. He faced world title contender Vanes Martirosyan on March 28, 2015. Both fighters put on a good show, but Charlo ultimately won a very close fight by a unanimous decision from the judges. He beat Joachim Alcine by technical knockout in the sixth round in his only other fight of 2015. \nThe string of impressive wins over highly ranked opponents let Jermell Charlo fight for his first world title on May 21, 2016. The match was against John Johnson for the vacant WBC light middleweight title at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. The prestigious title was only available because Floyd Mayweather Jr. retired earlier in the year. Both boxers were rather inexperienced in 12-round matches, but the fight would not last that long. Jackson was knocked out by flurry of punches in the eighth round after dominating the first seven rounds. ",

  "description": "Danny Garcia is a professional boxer who is currently fighting in the welterweight division. Garcia was born in Philadelphia Pennsylvania to parents who are from Puerto Rico. Garcia\u2019s father introduced him to boxing by taking him to Philadelphia\u2019s Harrowgate Boxing Club. Garcia\u2019s father has been his primary boxing coach since the start of his boxing career. Danny Garcia had a successful amateur boxing career, winning over 100 fights while being honored as a U.S. National Champion. \nGarcia turned pro with the intention of being recognized as one of the greatest Puerto Rican fighters of all time. He choose the nickname of Swift, as he begun his professional career. He won his debut fight against Mike Denby by knockout. Garcia continued to show great potential as prospect, fighting on the undercards of great champions like Floyd Mayweather Jr and Bernard Hopkins. After 15 successful fights, he decided to step up in competition by facing Ashley Theopane. he was tested but survived winning by split decision. Boxing pundits really recognized that Swift was headed for stardom when he defeated Mike Arnaoutis, Nate Campbell, Kendall Holt, and legendary Mexican champion Erik Morales in consecutive fights.\nDanny\u2019s first big fight was against Amir Khan as both his WBC Junior Welterweight and Khan\u2019s WBA Junior Welterweight titles were on the line. Khan started off well and seemed to be in control until he was caught with a left hook and dropped. He continued delivering punishment on his way to a stoppage victory, which earned him the WBC, WBA, and Ring Junior Welterweight titles. He made successful defenses against Erik Morales in a rematch, as well as Zab Judah before taking on Lucas Matthysse in his signature fight. Matthysse was favored to win, and many people expected to see Matthysse knock Danny Garcia out. However, he was able to withstand the punching power of Matthysse, knocking him down in the 11th round. Danny soon earned the recognition of a potential top fighter in the sport. He showed that he has a strong chin capable of standing up against power punchers in addition to the strong offensive skills that brought him success. \nDanny\u2019s career started to take a controversial turn after his victory over Matthysse, as he won disputed decisions over Mauricio Herrera and Lamont Peterson. Herrera\u2019s jab caused him lots of problems throughout the fight, even though many fans feel that he was nervous, due to fighting in Puerto Rico for the first time. He desperately wanted to put on a great performance. He once again started slow against Peterson and had trouble figuring out his style. Peterson also made the most of his physical size advantage over Danny. He came back in the later rounds, but the fight could have went either way according to most boxing fans and analysts. \nDanny decided to move to welterweight, defeating Paulie Malignaggi in his first fight in the division. He defeated Robert Guerrero to win the WBC welterweight title. He defeated Samuel Vargas by 7th round KO.",

  "description": "Born in Los Angeles, California on May 10, 1989, Jessie Vargas is a boxer with excellent technical skills honed by years of amateur fighting experience. He won two national championships in Mexico and two junior national championships in the United States, and also earned a spot on Mexico\u2019s 2008 Olympic boxing team. By the end of his amateur career, he had compiled a record of 120-20.\nA few months after turning 19, Vargas made his professional debut on September 5, 2008 against the 1-0 Joel Gonzalez. He made sure the fight didn\u2019t last long, as he scored a KO in the very first round. He followed that up with three more fights, one every month, to close out 2008, earning two decisions and one stoppage after two rounds.\nJessie Vargas would go on to pile up the victories, eventually building a record of 21-0. That earned him his first title fight, a match against the 23-0 Wale Omotoso on March 16, 2013 for the WBC Continental Americas welterweight title. He ended up cruising to a win by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.\nAfter another 10-round decision win, this one over Ray Narh, he fought Khabib Allakhverdiev for the WBA and IBO super lightweight titles. This fight, which took place on April 12, 2014, was his first that was scheduled for 12 rounds. It ended up going the distance, with Vargas picking up another unanimous decision victory. He would defend his WBA belt twice after that, against Anton Novikov and Antonio DeMarco, with the results being the same \u2013 unanimous decision victories after the full 12 rounds.\nOne reason Jessie Vargas hadn\u2019t broken through, despite his skill and his 26-0 record, was his lack of finishing ability. From September 17, 2011 to November 22, 2014, he won 10 fights in convincing fashion, but all of those were wins by decision. When he started working with Dewey Cooper, the trainer claimed he had helped the young fighter improve his punching power, although many scoffed at this and said that power was a natural trait that Vargas simply didn\u2019t have.\nHe got his highest-profile fight to date in his next match, which was on June 27, 2015 against Timothy Bradley, known for his rivalry with Manny Pacquiao. The fight was for the WBO interim welterweight title, and for the most part, it wasn\u2019t close. Bradley continually landed sharp punching combinations throughout the fight, but Jessie had his moment in the 12th and final round, stunning Bradley with a hard right hand. He pounced and went for the finish, but unfortunately the referee made a mistake, believing that the 10-second warning was the signal for the end of the fight. That meant the fight was stopped early and went to a decision, where Bradley won on all the scorecards.\nVargas bounced back when he took out Sadam Ali with a dominant performance, eventually scoring a TKO in the ninth round to win the WBO welterweight title. Next, he faced superstar Manny Pacquiao, and while he fought hard, he ended up losing a unanimous decision.",

  "description": "Born on October 1, 1995 in Orlando, Florida, Erickson Lubin is a junior middleweight boxer who is known for being strong mentally and physically, along with possessing sharp technique. A fighter in the classic boxer-puncher mold, he can deliver powerful shots from both hands, and both technicians and analysts appreciate how he attacks the body, which can sometimes seem like a lost art.\nLubin went to boxing gyms with his older brother when he was only 3-years-old, and soon he too was training. He first fought as an amateur when he was 8, and when he started training under Jason Galarza at 13, he didn\u2019t lose another amateur fight. He amassed an amateur record of 143-7 and won the junior Olympics twice, and his skill had many in the USA Boxing program picking him as a future Olympic gold medalist. He surprised USA Boxing when he instead decided to turn pro at just 18, signing with Iron Mike Promotions. USA Boxing president Charles Butler was so upset by this that he wrote Mike Tyson an open letter claiming that the former heavyweight champion interfered with Olympic process, although Tyson says that it was the young boxer\u2019s own choice to turn professional.\nHis first fight came on November 26, 2013 against Eric De Jesus, and Lubin showed that he was definitely ready for the big leagues as he scored a KO in the very first round. His first three fights were all dominant first round stoppages. His fourth opponent, Tirobio Ball, made it to the third round before losing by TKO, while his fifth opponent, Jovan Ramirez, lost via second-round KO.\nIt wasn\u2019t until fight number six that Erickson Lubin saw the scorecards for the first time, and he defeated Noe Bolanos by unanimous decision after eight rounds of action. He followed that up by beating down Francisco Javier Reza and stopping him after just one round.\nWhile Lubin fought primarily lower-level opponents throughout the beginning of his career, the young fighter stayed very active, as he fought seven times in 2014, with one of those fights coming just 15 days after his previous fight. Most importantly, he won every fight and he did so in dominant fashion.\nAfter running his record to 11-0, Erickson Lubin got one of the first tests of his young career when he fought Orlando Lora, a game fighter who had challenged several top-ranked boxers over the years, albeit in losing efforts. Lubin showed his star potential in that fight, as he easily dispatched Lora with a sixth-round TKO. He closed out 2015 with another TKO, this one over Alexis Camacho in the second round.\n2016 was another big year for the boxer known as \u201cThe Hammer\u201d for his punching power. He started off with a unanimous decision win over Jose De Jesus Macias on January 31, 2016. He scored a third-round TKO over Daniel Sandoval in June, then fought again in July and won a unanimous decision over Ivan Montero. He again finished the year with a bang, knocking out Juan Ubaldo Cabrera in the second round, which resulted in ESPN naming him its 2016 prospect of the year.",

  "description": "Born on October 15, 1993 in Birmingham, West Midlands, England, Sam Eggington didn\u2019t plan to become a professional boxer. He got into the sport because his older brother started training, and he had a decent, but unspectacular amateur career, finishing with a 31-9 record. As a young man, he was working as a forklift driver, but he lost his job and had a son to support, so he went to Jon Pegg\u2019s boxing gym and inquired about becoming a journeyman fighter. After showing that he knew what he was doing in a sparring session, Pegg agreed to get him fights.\nEggington made his pro debut on September 14, 2012 and defeated the 2-0-1 Leon Findlay on points after four rounds. At that point, he figured he may be able to do more than just be a journeyman. By the end of the year, he had picked up another two wins on points.\nOn January 19, 2013, he joined the Prizefighter tournament, but he dropped a unanimous decision against Dale Evans after three rounds. He fought again just over a month later and had his first finish, a second-round KO, albeit against the 0-8 Vaclav Skromach. That was good enough to earn him a shot at the British Midlands Area welterweight title against the 7-1 Steven Pearce, who was perhaps his toughest opponent to that point. Sam Eggington stepped up his performance and scored a TKO in the seventh round to win the belt.\nHe followed that up with three more victories, and with a record of 8-1, he joined another Prizefighter tournament. This time around, he won his quarterfinals match against Johnny Garton by second-round TKO, but later that night, he dropped a split decision to Johnny Coyle to get bounced from the tournament in the semis.\nOnce again, Eggington rebounded after a tournament loss, picking up two victories over journeyman opponents. On September 13, 2014, he fought 20-1 Denton Vassell and got the finish against a tough opponent, winning by way of TKO in the eighth round. He ended his next fight even more quickly, stopping Sebastien Allais by TKO in round one. For his efforts, he got to fight for the WBC International Silver welterweight title against the 20-0 Shayne Singleton. He erased Singleton\u2019s undefeated record by scoring a fifth-round TKO.\nSam Eggington picked up belts in his next two fights, first the Commonwealth welterweight title with a seventh-round TKO over Joseph Lamptey, and then the British welterweight title with a technical decision over Glenn Foot after eight rounds. After beating Dale Evans by unanimous decision to avenge his first loss, he dropped a 12-round unanimous decision to Bradley Skeete on March 5, 2016.\nEggington got back to his winning ways, putting together a streak of impressive finishes. He knocked out Daza Usher in the first round, and then won the WBC International welterweight title when he took out Frankie Gavin by TKO on October 22, 2016. On March 4, 2017, he knocked out former world champion Paulie Malignaggi in the eighth round with a powerful combination.",

  "description": "Born on May 3, 1986 and hailing from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, Kell Brook cut his teeth in Brendan Ingle\u2019s Wincobank boxing gym, the same place where the electrifying Prince Naseem Hamed trained. He was nine years old when he started working out at the gym, going through many of Ingle\u2019s famous drills. He had a fairly successful amateur career where he won four national titles, and then turned pro at 18 years old.\nHis first professional fight occurred on September 17, 2004, and to say he was at an experience disadvantage would be a massive understatement. His opponent, Peter Buckley, had 230 fights at the time, although his record was a poor 31-189-10. Brook ended up cruising to a comfortable victory on points after six rounds. He would stay very active throughout the rest of the year, fighting once in October, once in November and twice in December. He ended up scoring three straight TKOs, two in the first round, and picking up another points win after six rounds to close out the year.\nFor almost the first four years of his career, he fought journeyman fighters, most of whom had losing records. However, he was beating all of them, staying active and demonstrating that he had potential. His technique was sharp, and he could switch smoothly from orthodox to southpaw at any time. He had a very relaxed, fluid style and could stay defensively sound even though he had his hands held rather low.\nIt wasn\u2019t until June 14, 2008 that he got his first opponent with a strong record in the 15-1 Barrie Jones, who had stepped up and taken the fight on short notice. Kell was 16-0 at the time, and the two were fighting for the British welterweight title. Kell Brook showed that he could step his game up for the big fights, as he scored an impressive TKO stoppage in the seventh round to take the belt.\nWhile his level of competition rose from here on out, he continued to step his game up, scoring TKO after TKO. He defended that British welterweight title three times with three impressive victories, resulting in his being named the young British boxer of the year. To kick off 2010, he got a shot at the WBO Inter-Continental welterweight title against Krzysztof Bienias, who was on a 17-fight winning streak. That streak ended decisively as Brook took control of the fight from the very beginning, eventually battering Bienias in the sixth round for a TKO.\nHis two other fights in 2010 were a fifth-round TKO win over Michael Jennings and a second-round TKO win over Philip Kotey. That put him on a streak of eight consecutive stoppage victories and ran his record to a perfect 23-0, which set him up with another title shot. It was for the WBA Inter-Continental welterweight title, against Lovemore N\u2019dou on June 25, 2011. He didn\u2019t keep his streak of stoppages alive, but he did win the belt with a clear 12-round unanimous decision victory.\nHe had two other fights in 2011, against Rafal Jackiewicz and Luis Galarza, and won both of them by way of TKO. In the fight against Galarza, he got the chance to introduce himself in person to an American audience. Taking place in Atlantic City, New Jersey, it was his first fight in the United States.\nNext up was another title shot, this time for the IBF International welterweight belt. He fought Matthew Hatton, brother of British boxing great Ricky Hatton, in Sheffield on March 17, 2012. He had another impressive performance in a title fight, knocking Hatton down once in the ninth round and picking up a clear unanimous decision victory. His next fight, however, was his most trying up to that point. He faced the American boxer Carson Jones in Sheffield on July 7, 2012. In an incredible fight, Kell Brook started strong before tiring and getting his nose broken in round eight. He showed his heart by fighting until the end, hanging on even after taking heavy punishment in the final round. He ended up winning by majority decision, with scores of 116-113, 115-113 and 114-114, then going to the hospital immediately afterwards because of all the blood he had lost.\nIn his next fight, he took out Hector Saldivia with ease, notching a third-round TKO. After injury issues with both Brook and potential opponents of his, his next fight ended up being a rematch with Jones. This time around, he started strong and never looked back, eventually scoring an eight-round TKO to leave no doubt that he was the better fighter.\nAfter two more TKO victories, he got his first shot at a world title in a match against the 24-0-1 Shawn Porter, who was the favorite, at the StubHub Center in Carson, California. The highly-anticipated fight took place on August 16, 2014, and it lived up to the hype. Kell had to weather an early storm, before fighting back to take control. It was a competitive contest, and he ended up winning a majority decision by scores of 117-111, 116-112 and 114-114.\nHe made three defenses of his welterweight title and scored three dominant stoppage victories in the fourth, sixth and second rounds. While he was then going to fight Jessie Vargas, the WBO welterweight champion, to unify their belts, the negotiations for that fight ended up falling through. Instead, he decided to jump up two weight divisions to middleweight, taking on the vicious, undefeated power puncher Gennady Golovkin. On September 10, 2016 at the 02 Arena in London he fought Golovkin for the WBC, IBF and IBO middleweight titles. The fact that he was putting his own 36-0 record on the line to move up in weight and take on such a dangerous fighter showed his courage, and he fared better than many of Golovkin\u2019s victims. He hung on after taking heavy shots and even fired right back, but he ended up with an injured eye socket. During a particularly brutal sequence in the fifth round, his trainer threw in the towel to save him from any further punishment.",

  "description": "Born on July 27, 1988 in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, Liam Smith comes from a boxing family, as his three brothers also became professional boxers. He had a strong amateur career, winning the 2007 and 2008 ABA Championships, and then deciding to turn pro.\nHe had his first fight on October 10, 2008 against Duncan Cottier, who sported a 2-43-3 record. Smith cruised to an easy decision victory on points after four rounds. In his next fight two months later, he got his first stoppage with an impressive first-round TKO of John Van Emmenis.\nIn his next three fights, he picked up three wins on points, albeit against weak competition. All the boxers he faced had losing records, and his sixth fight against the 6-5-4 Terry Carruthers was his first against anyone with a winning record. It wasn\u2019t a good performance by Liam Smith, as he couldn\u2019t do enough to get the win. Instead, the fight was ruled a draw after four rounds.\nTo his credit, Smith bounced back well after that draw, scoring a TKO over Matt Scriven in the second round on December 11, 2010. On September 17, 2011, he took on his toughest opponent to that point in the 16-8 Barrie Jones and won by KO in the third round. He followed that up less than a month later with a first-round KO over Gerard Healy.\nDespite his string of three consecutive finishes, he wasn\u2019t the most highly regarded prospect at that point in his career. He had good technique and solid power. He was facing low-level competition, but that\u2019s common to start a career, especially in England. However, he wasn\u2019t as active as many fighters were when starting out, occasionally having breaks of six months or more between fights.\nAfter running his record to 12-0-1 and staying very active throughout 2012, he got to fight for the Commonwealth light middleweight title on December 15, 2012 against Steve O\u2019Meara. He took the fight by unanimous decision after 12 rounds. Two fights later, he earned the British light middleweight title when he beat Erick Ochieng by 12-round unanimous decision.\nLiam Smith went on one of the more impressive runs of his career next, as he started landing harder shots on his opponents and put together a streak of eight consecutive finishes from December 7, 2013 to June 4, 2016. He also added three belts to his collection over that winning streak, the WBA Continental light middleweight title, the WBO Inter-Continental light middleweight title and the WBO light middleweight title.\nThat set up his first match outside of England, as he traveled to Arlington, Texas on September 17, 2016 to take on the Mexican superstar, Saul Canelo Alvarez. Many felt that he would be outmatched by Canelo, who was much larger and seen as the far superior boxer. Unfortunately for Smith, those predictions proved accurate. He fought hard throughout the contest, but Canelo dropped him in the seventh and eighth rounds with powerful punches, and then finished him off with a brutal left hook to the body in round nine, wiping out his undefeated record.",

  "description": "Chris Eubank Jr is one of those fighters who can truthfully state that boxing is in his blood, as he\u2019s the son of former WBO middleweight and super middleweight champion Chris Eubank Sr. He was born in Hove, East Sussex, England, and even gained a bit of exposure during his early years when he appeared on the reality TV show \u201cAt Home with the Eubanks.\u201d When he was 16, he went to the United States with his brother to live with a guardian. Their mother later explained that this was done so both boys would have dual citizenship, and to give them a better chance of success in professional sports.\nEubank started his amateur boxing career shortly after getting to the United States, and he quickly climbed the ranks. First, he became Nevada\u2019s Amateur Golden Glove Champion. Next, he became the Amateur Golden Glove Champion for the Western States, and that was after having only eight amateur fights. He also competed in the 2008 National Golden Gloves, where he had one win and one loss. Overall, he went 24-2 as an amateur, for a successful but short amateur career.\nBy 2011, he had decided to turn pro, and he made his debut in Manchester on November 12, 2011. He fought Kirilas Psonko and had a dominant performance, scoring a TKO in the fourth round. He quickly built up a streak of wins, fighting often in England, Ireland and Denmark. Although three out of his first five wins went to the scorecards, he still demonstrated solid power in his bouts, and as he got further into his career he became more dangerous, collecting more TKO victories.\nThe one criticism that could be levelled at him during the start of his career was the lack of high-level competition, which is the case for many boxers when they begin their professional careers. His early fights were against what many would refer to as subpar competition. The only fighter he faced with much of a name was Bradley Pryce on December 8, 2012. Pryce had held multiple national titles, although he was on the downswing of his career by that point. Still, Chris Eubank Jr picked up a solid, albeit unspectacular win on points.\nHe had amassed an impressive 18-0 record and had finished 10 straight opponents when he earned his first title fight. It was on November 29, 2014, and the opponent was Billy Joe Saunders, a slick fighter who had boxed in the 2008 Olympics. The fight was for Saunders\u2019 European, British and Commonwealth middleweight titles, and it was also a title-eliminator fight for WBO world middleweight title. Saunders\u2019 big fight experience was apparent from the outset, as he controlled the fight for the first six rounds. Eubank, on the other hand, didn\u2019t do much for that first half of the fight, keeping a very slow pace that led many to think he was nervous from the pressure of his first big fight. To his credit, he started fighting with much more intensity from the seventh round through the end of the fight, turning the match into an exciting slugfest. However, his slow start likely cost him the fight, as he lost the fight via split decision, with the scores being 115-114, 115-114 and 113-116.\nThree months later, the young fighter bounced back with a dominant victory over Dmitry Chudinov for the WBA interim middleweight title, stopping Chudinov in the 12th round. He then destroyed Tony Jeter in two rounds later that year and closed the year out with another stoppage against Gary O\u2019Sullivan.\nHis next fight was against Nick Blackwell for the British middleweight championship, and the fight received international attention for what happened in the ring and afterwards. With Eubank dominating the fight from the beginning, it was clear that Blackwell was outclassed and could get badly hurt. That\u2019s when the young boxer\u2019s father instructed him between rounds to hit Blackwell to the body instead of the head, both to stop him more quickly and to prevent further serious damage since the referee wasn\u2019t taking the initiative to stop the fight.\nThe referee eventually did call the fight in the 10th round, but Blackwell still needed to go to the hospital immediately afterwards. Tests showed that he had bleeding in his brain, and he was put in a medically-induced coma. Fortunately, he did make a full recovery, although he had to retire because of his injuries.\nChris Eubank Jr moved on to a fight against Tom Doran at the 02 Arena, the site of a few of his memorable performances. He put on another one against Doran, knocking the game fighter down once in the third round and then three times in the fourth to earn himself a TKO victory. He also called out Gennady Golovkin in his post-fight interview, which is impressive merely for how few fighters wanted to take on the dangerous boxer known as \u201cGGG\u201d at that time.\nEubank followed in his father\u2019s footsteps for his next fight, as he jumped up a division to take on Renold Quinlan for his IBO super middleweight title. As the smaller fighter, he was able to use his superior speed to his advantage, particularly after about the fifth round, when he started to pour it on with ferocious punching combinations. After several rounds of Quinlan absorbing punishment, the referee stopped the fight in the 10th round, as he was simply leaning on the ropes taking shot after shot.\nEubank would return five months later to fight the ageing veteran Arthur Abraham, picking up a comfortable points victory over the slow German. Just before the fight, it was announced that the winner would enter the World Boxing Super Series at Super Middleweight.\nEubank would face off against Turk, Avni Yildirim, in the quarter-final in Stuttgart in October 2017. Arguably his most impressive victory to date, he knocked Yildirim out in spectacular fashion in the third round. This victory would set up an all British semi-final against Geroge Groves in Manchester in February 2018.\nIn his biggest contest to date, Eubank struggled to gain a foothold in their eventual fight, losing on the scorecards. This loss would yet again draw criticisms of Eubanks training methods and boxing ability at the highest level.\nIt\u2019s not easy to be the son of a champion, but Eubank Jr has done an admirable job of living up to the family name. Despite some deserved criticism, he\u2019s an excellent all-around fighter, with great technical skills, speed, and power, along with the heart to press forward even in difficult fights. He also benefits from having his father in his corner to guide him, learning from the retired champion\u2019s wealth of experience.",

  "description": "Born on May 19, 1990 in Lafayette, Louisiana, Jermall Charlo comes from a boxing family. His father was a boxer, and his twin brother, Jermell is also a professional boxer. Both brothers began boxing when they went to the gym with their father at 9-years-old, and Jermell turned pro in 2007. Jermall Charlo waited another year, as he wanted to earn a place on the 2008 USA Olympic Boxing team, but a toe injury kept him from competing for a spot. He finished his amateur career with a record of 65-6, and then made his professional debut in 2008.\nFor his first fight on August 12, 2008, Charlo fought Cimmaron Davis and scored a second-round TKO. He won his first four fights convincingly, with two TKOs and two unanimous decisions, and then went up against Deon Nash, a fighter his brother had beaten already. He won a unanimous decision, then defeated Carlos Garcia by unanimous decision in his next fight. After that, he took on Nash in a rematch, and beat him even more decisively this time around, as Nash\u2019s corner stopped the contest after just two rounds.\nThat kicked off a string of finishes, as he won every fight for the next four years by either TKO, KO or a corner retirement. While many of those victories were over journeyman fighters, he also defeated several notable fighters, including Orlando Lora, Antwone Smith and Norberto Gonzalez, establishing himself as a strong prospect in the junior middleweight division. He faced off against another highly touted fighter on March 28, 2015 when he fought Michael Kenneth Finney, who had a strong amateur career. Finney was the first fighter to take him to a decision since Carlos Garcia, but Charlo still took the fight fairly easily by unanimous decision.\nWith that victory, he earned a shot at the IBF junior middleweight title. His opponent, Cornelius Bundrage, was a solid fighter and the current champion, but he was no match for a faster, more powerful and younger opponent. He knocked Bundrage down four times, once each in the first two rounds and twice in round three, with the final knockdown resulting in a KO. Charlo defended his title for the first time on November 28, 2015, against another game opponent in the 21-1 Wilky Campfort. Again, he made the veteran look like an amateur, dropping Campfort with a counter in round two and then forcing Campfort to a knee in round three. He then landed a beautiful uppercut towards the end of the round that put Campfort on his knee again, and because Campfort couldn\u2019t see, the referee stopped the fight.\nJermell Charlo defended his title twice in 2016, once against Austin Trout in a close unanimous decision win, and then at the end of the year with a fifth-round TKO of Julian Williams. His brother Jermell won the WBC light middleweight title that same year. On February 16, 2017, Charlo chose to vacate his IBF junior middleweight title due to the difficult weight cut and a lack of challengers, deciding to move up to middleweight.",

  "description": "One of the most devastating punches in middleweight history, Gennady Golovkin has racked up quite a few knockouts over the course of his career. Born on April 8, 1982 in Kazakhstan, he was fighting from a young age, as his brothers would encourage him to fight grown men on the streets even when he was a young child. He started his boxing training at 8 years old and won quite a few championships as a younger fighter, with highlights including his 2002 gold medal as a middleweight in the Asian Games, his 2003 gold medal at middleweight in the World Championships and his 2004 gold medal at middleweight in the Asian Championships. He also competed in the 2004 Olympics and earned a silver medal.\nAfter a very successful amateur career where he went 345-5, Golovkin had his first professional fight on May 6, 2006, and it didn\u2019t last long. He knocked out his opponent, Gabor Balogh, in the very first round. He ended up fighting six times before the end of the year, winning all of them by stoppage. That streak continued over his first two fights in 2007, and he built a record of 8-0 with finishes in every fight. He then had his first decision win against Mehdi Bouadla on September 7, 2007.\nThe fighter who would later be known as GGG due to his initials may have been fighting relative unknowns on small cards in Germany, but he was taking them out in dominant fashion. His talent was obvious to anyone watching him fight, as he wasn\u2019t merely a power puncher. He was an excellent pressure fighter, skilled at cutting off the ring and forcing his opponents into the perfect position to land those brutal blows. His chin was rock solid, and he would also punch at unique angles, often catching his opponents by surprise.\nWith a 16-0 record, he got a shot for the WBO Inter-Continental middleweight title on July 11, 2009. He took advantage by knocking out John Anderson Carvalho in just two rounds. After another second-round KO, this one against Mikhail Makarov, he then fought Milton Nunez on August 14, 2010 for the WBA interim middleweight title. This time around, he only needed one round for another brutal knockout victory.\nWhen he had two title defenses under his belt, he took on Lajuan Simon for the IBO middleweight title. He again took care of his opponent early, scoring a KO in the very first round. A third-round TKO victory over Makoto Fuchigami followed.\nGennady Golovkin then finally got to introduce himself to an American audience in his first fight on U.S. soil, which took place on September 1, 2012 in Verona, New York. He put on a show against Grzegorz Proksa, who was 28-1 at the time, becoming the first man to stop him when he earned a TKO in the fifth round. His next fight was at Madison Square Garden, and on the bigger stage he put on perhaps a bigger beating, smashing Gabriel Rosado from the opening bell until the American fighter\u2019s corner threw in the towel in the seventh round.\nAfter two third-round KO victories, he took on highly ranked Curtis Stevens, once again at Madison Square Garden. It was another vicious performance that earned him international acclaim, as he absolutely battered Stevens. He knocked Stevens down with a clean series of two left hooks in round two, and while Stevens fought gamely, his corner stopped the fight after the eighth round because of the cumulative damage.\nHis next fight was February 1, 2014 in Monte Carlo, Monaco against Osumanu Adama, and after four knockdowns, the referee stopped the fight and he won by TKO in round seven. Next, he went back to Madison Square Garden for a fight against Daniel Geale on July 26, 2014. It was another methodical, yet vicious performance, where he started everything off with his crisp, snapping left jab. Soon he was landing his power punches, and the fight was over in the third round.\nHe got the opportunity to add the WBC interim middleweight title to his collection when he took on Marco Antonio Rubio in Carson, California at the StubHub Center. He needed barely more than a round to take the belt, notching another devastating KO win.\nHe went back to Monte Carlo to defend his titles against Martin Murray on February 21, 2015. While his opponent had sound defense and the toughness to keep going even while taking punishment, Golovkin eventually proved to be too much, as he forced the referee to step in and save Murray from any more damage in round 11.\nOn May 16, 2015, he fought Willie Monroe Jr. at The Forum in Inglewood, California. While Monroe Jr. was light on his feet and used effective movement to stay relatively safe over the first five rounds, the Kazakhstani fighter eventually forced him to the ropes and landed hard punches for a TKO win in the sixth round.\nAnother fight at Madison Square Garden was next, this one against David Lemieux on October 15, 2015 with the IBF middleweight title on the line. He was in full control of the fight from start to finish, which came by way of TKO in round eight. He was back in The Forum next to defend his belts against Dominic Wade, who was a heavy underdog. The odds makers proved to be right about that, as Gennady Golovkin easily defeated Wade with a KO in the second round.\nHe then traveled to The 02 Arena in London, England to take on hometown favorite Kell Brook on September 10, 2016. Originally, the plan was for him to fight Chris Eubank Jr., but after negotiations for that fight broke down, Brook took the fight, going up two weight divisions in the process. To his credit, Brook fought hard, even after suffering a broken right eye socket. He threw plenty of punches back, but couldn\u2019t seem to harm the larger fighter. By the middle of the fifth round, Golovkin was landing shots at will, forcing Brook\u2019s corner to throw in the towel to protect their fighter.",

  "description": "Born on May 26, 1992 in Church Village, Wales, Liam Williams is a scrappy fighter who started his boxing training when he was just 9 years old. Although no one else in his family was into boxing, he went with a friend to the Rhondda Amateur Boxing Club due to his love of fighting. Williams had a successful amateur career, winning a total of seven Welsh titles and six British titles. His most impressive achievement as an amateur was winning the 2011 Senior ABA Championships. He finished his amateur career with 44 wins in 49 fights.\nWhen he turned pro, he trained out of Enzo Calzaghe\u2019s Newbridge boxing club under Gary Lockett. He had his professional debut when he was 19 years old, fighting Ryan Clark on November 19, 2011. Considering Clark\u2019s record at the time was 1-44-4, it was clear he was brought in to lose, and Williams ended up winning on points. He would follow that up by notching two more points victories over two more fighters with subpar records, the 4-8 Tommy Tolan and the 1-2 Gilson De Jesus.\nLiam Williams started to come into his own more in his next three fights, earning TKO victories in each of them. After another decision win, he had his first fight against a boxer with a winning record when he faced the 6-1 Darren Codona on August 17, 2013. He ended up winning another decision.\nHis next fight was against Tyan Booth, and it ended up being ruled a draw by technical decision. To that point in his career, Liam Williams had been winning, but he hadn\u2019t been particularly impressive in doing so. The majority of his fights were against low-level boxers with far more losses than victories, and he hadn\u2019t fought anyone of note. However, he seemed to turn a corner after the draw against Booth, as he would go on a string of stoppage victories, showing that he did have the ability to be a finisher.\nFirst, he won a TKO against Yuri Pompilio. He followed that with an excellent performance against the 15-1 Ronnie Heffron and won by corner stoppage. A KO victory over Stepan Horvath set him up for a shot at the Commonwealth super welterweight title on November 24, 2014 against Michael Lomax. He put on a show in his first title fight and won by a dominant TKO. In his next fight against Kris Carslaw, he scored another TKO victory and added the BBBofC super welterweight title to his collection.\nHe held on to his belts with another TKO on June 4, 2016, this one over Gustavo Alberto Sanchez. Barely over a month later he fought Gary Corcoran, who was 15-0, and earned another TKO to hand Corcoran his first loss.\nWith his impressive performances, Williams ended up with a shot at the WBO European super welterweight title in his next fight, which took place on November 26, 2016. He was fighting Gabor Gorbics, and the result was the same as it was in his previous four fights \u2013 a win by TKO.",

  "description": "Ever since childhood, Anthony \u201cThe Dog\u201d Dirrell lived by one motto: Train hard, fight hard. By always pushing himself to the next level throughout his life, this professional boxer has accumulated an impressive number of victories and milestones since his debut in 2005.\nAs a child, Dirrell grew up attending the school of hard knocks. Flint, Michigan was a difficult area in the \u201980s, and many of Dirrell\u2019s friends and family members succumbed to a life of crime or death. Raised by his grandfather, he instilled in Anthony the values of hard work and respect. Looking for a way to channel his energy into a positive environment, Anthony found his passion in boxing. Boxing runs in his blood, as his brother, uncle and cousins before him all practiced the sport. With some motivation from his grandfather, Anthony Dirrell laced up a pair of gloves for the first time to try boxing for himself. After being victorious in his first amateur event in Saginaw, Michigan, Anthony knew that a career in boxing was in his future.\nDirrell officially turned pro in 2005, and his first match was against a powerful opponent: Henry Dukes. Anthony ran circles around his opponent, scoring a TKO on him in the first round. This first round victory set the pace for Dirrell\u2019s next few matches. In his second professional fight, he beat Dewayne Warren in the second round by TKO, but not before knocking his opponent down a few times in the first round. Anthony would then beat Larry Brothers in the second round by TKO and Mike Walthier in the first round with a powerful knockout punch.\nDirrell\u2019s first challenge came at the hands of Gabriel Riviera. Riviera was on a win streak of his own; just like Anthony Dirrell, Riviera had won his last four fights. Only one man would come out of this battle the victor, and that man was Anthony. This win would help propel Anthony to a 26 fight win streak, with Anthony typically knocking his opponents out by the second round, if not the first. This win streak would earn Anthony the right to challenge Sakio Bika for the WBC Super Middleweight title.\nHowever, Bika proved to be more of a challenge than Anthony expected. When the fight continued past the second round, fans knew they were in for the fight of a lifetime. In an unprecedented outcome, the bout lasted the entire 12 rounds, with the judges ruling the fight a draw. While not technically a loss, this is the first fight in which Anthony was not the victor. On August 16, 2014, the two men met again in a rematch, and after another 12-round match, Anthony won the title by unanimous decision. However, he wouldn\u2019t hold the title long, as Badou Jack would hand this boxer his first loss in 2015.\nThroughout his career, Anthony Dirrell has overcome the odds. Despite a cancer diagnosis and a motorcycle accident, the boxer is still a force of nature in the ring. When it comes to overpowering an opponent and putting a stop to them early in the fight, few are better than this super middleweight boxer.",

  "description": "A Mexican fan favorite who was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco on July 18, 1990, Saul Canelo Alvarez certainly comes from a boxing family. He\u2019s the youngest of eight children, and all of the seven boys went on to become professional boxers. He got his nickname, Canelo, from his red hair.\nHe began training when he was 13, inspired after seeing his brother\u2019s debut. Within a year, he was taking silver in the Junior Mexican National championships. At the same championships the next year, he became the champion. However, his trainers were having trouble finding anyone who wanted to fight him, so shortly after his championship he turned pro at only 15 years old. His amateur career ended with a record of 44-2.\nHis first professional fight was against Abraham Gonzalez on October 29, 2005, and he won it by TKO in the fourth round. He followed that up with a KO in round two against Pablo Alvarado, and then a split decision victory against Miguel Vazquez. After a first-round KO against Pedro Lopez, he fought Jorge Juarez and the fight was ruled a split draw.\nAlvarez followed the draw up with a streak of eight consecutive wins by either KO or TKO, running his record to 12-0-1. He was staying active, and his trainers have said that he actually had an additional 10 KOs during that time span, but the small shows where he was fighting didn\u2019t have very good recordkeeping. Regardless, he was fighting and dominating fighters much older than himself, demonstrating superstar potential. He was also staying active, as he would have seven official fights per year from 2006 to 2009.\nAfter a unanimous decision victory over Christian Solano, he earned a shot at the Jalisco welterweight title on August 31, 2007 against Ricardo Cano. He easily took the fight after 12 rounds by unanimous decision. His next opportunity at a title was a few fights later on April 18, 2008, and he stopped Gabriel Martinez in 10 rounds to win the WBA Fedecentro welterweight title.\nWith three years of fighting in Mexico under his belt, he took his first trip to the United States on October 24, 2008 to face Larry Mosley in Cabazon, California. He won a clear unanimous decision after 10 rounds. His next fight was a month and a half later in Miami, Florida, and it didn\u2019t last long, as he scored a TKO against Raul Pinzon in just one round.\nAlthough his level of competition was increasing from relatively unknown fighters to more skilled boxers, Saul Canelo Alvarez was also improving. In the tradition of Mexican fighters, he liked to come forward and was adept at working both the body and head, particularly with his dangerous left hook. However, he was more than just a swarmer, as he also possessed sound defense, particularly in his ability to roll with punches.\nDuring a string of victories, he picked up the NABF, WBO Latino and WBC Youth welterweight titles, along with the WBC Silver light middleweight title. With his record at 34-0-1, he took on the highly regarded Carlos Baldomir, who said he would knock out the young Mexican fighter. The exact opposite occurred, as Saul took out Baldomir in the sixth round, knocking him out cold in an electrifying performance.\nAfter a unanimous decision win over Lovemore N\u2019dou, he got his first world title shot for the WBC light middleweight title against Matthew Hatton. He dominated the proceedings and took a clear unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring it 119-108. He would then make five defenses of the belt, with TKO victories over Ryan Rhodes, Alfonso Gomez and Kermit Cintron, a unanimous decision against Shane Mosley and another TKO against Josesito Lopez. That set up a fight against Austin Trout with the WBC, WBA and The Ring light middleweight titles on the line. While Trout came in with a smart strategy and fought well, Alvarez put him down for the first time in his career with a seventh round knockdown and ended up taking a somewhat-close unanimous decision.\nThat set up a super fight between Saul Canelo Alvarez and one of the greatest fighters of all time in Floyd Mayweather Jr., who was moving back up in weight. It took place on September 14, 2013, and many felt that the younger fighter would give Mayweather one of his tougher tests, although few picked him to actually win. While the fight wasn\u2019t action packed, it ended up being a great contest between two highly skilled fighters. Mayweather ended up taking a majority decision, with the scorecards reading 117-111, 116-112 and 114-114. Some observers felt that Mayweather won by a wide margin, while others thought that people were being swayed by Mayweather\u2019s ability to always appear in control of the fight, even when an opponent is giving him trouble. Some analysts thought the fight was actually very close, and that people weren\u2019t noticing Alvarez\u2019s solid punches and defense. The fight certainly cemented the Mexican fighter as not just a star in his country but a star worldwide, as it sold 2.2 million pay-per-views.\nAlvarez got back to his winning ways with a TKO of Alfredo Angulo, but then he looked subpar in his next fight, winning a split decision against Erislandy Lara. He erased the memory of that poor performance with a brutal third-round KO of James Kirkland, and followed that up with a solid unanimous decision victory over Miguel Cotto, where he won the WBC, The Ring and lineal middleweight titles.\nHe defended those belts against Amir Khan on May 7, 2016. While he had some trouble with Khan\u2019s slick movement and jab in the early stages of the fight, he ended up finding his rhythm in the sixth round and landed a devastating right hand that put Khan to sleep. In his next fight, he took on Liam Smith for the WBO light middleweight title. He was in control from the very beginning, then scored knockdowns in rounds seven and eight before finishing Smith with a left hook to the body in the ninth round.",

  "description": "Daniel Jacobs is a professional boxer who was born in New York City\u2019s most populous borough, Brooklyn, on February 3, 1987. He spent his entire childhood in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn living in a house with his mom, aunts and grandma. He always had a love for the sport of boxing, and eventually started a prolific amateur career while attending Erasmus Hall High School.\nJacobs had an extremely busy amateur boxing career that saw him win a total of 137 of his 144 fights. He won the AAU Junior Olympics national championship at the age of 16. One year later, he became the welterweight champion in the National Golden Gloves tournament. After hitting a growth spurt and gaining weight, he had to fight in the middleweight division at the 2005 National Golden Gloves competition. The heavier competition did not stop Jacobs from winning another championship.\nThe extremely successful amateur career allowed Daniel to get national exposure during his first professional fight. This match took place at the MGM Grand Arena in Las Vegas on December 8, 2007. While the fight was schedule to go four rounds, it only took 29 seconds for Daniel to secure a technical knockout victory over his opponent, Jose Jesus Hurtado. Early knockout victories became a trend in the early portion of the New Yorker\u2019s career. Using early knockouts helped build a long undefeated streak that lasted a total of 20 professional fights. All but three of these 20 victories were won by knockout, and only one of the knockouts came after the fourth round. \nJacobs finally lost the first professional fight of his career when he faced Russia\u2019s Dmitry Pirog for the vacant WBO middleweight championship at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas on July 31, 2010. Pirog also entered the fight with a perfect record, and he quickly took control of the entire match. Pirog won the title fight with a technical knockout in the fifth round. \nDaniel\u2019s promising boxing career looked like it would be cut short way too early after he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in May 2011. Osteosarcoma is an extremely rare and deadly form of bone cancer. It took approximately 19 months to fully recover from the chemotherapy treatments, but Daniel Jacobs has been cancer-free since 2012.\nDaniel did not let the serious illness derail his impressive boxing career. He returned from the lengthy layoff with five straight knockout victories. All five wins also came no later than the fifth round. This impressive streak allowed him to get the second major title fight of his career. A bout against Australia\u2019s Jarrod Fletcher at Barclays Center in New York on August 9, 2014, was for the WBA middleweight title. Daniel fed off of his home crowd throughout the fight to secure a technical knockout victory over the Australian in the fifth round. He went on to successfully defend the WBA middleweight title against Caleb Truax, Sergio Mora and Peter Quillin. All of these title defenses were won by knockout. ",

  "description": "Badou \u201cThe Ripper\u201d Jack has always been a fighter; as one of eight children, you\u2019d likely find him on any given day roughhousing with his siblings. Born in Stockholm, Sweden, Badou Jack is half Gambian, half Swedish, which gives him a fiery passion that you won\u2019t see in many other boxers. Badou knew from an early age that he wanted to box, and the moment he was eligible for the amateur league at the age of 18, he signed up. Badou racked up an impressive 150-25 record while in the amateur league, earning a reputation as a fighter who can go the entire distance with his opponents and come out the victor. In 2007, Badou received the highest recognition an amateur boxer in Sweden can get, as he won the Boxer of the Year award from the Swedish Boxing Federation. He followed up this accomplishment by boxing in the 2008 Olympic Games for the country of Gambia. \nIn 2009, Badou Jack finally made the decision to go pro. After winning his first fight by unanimous decision, he easily won his next four fights with a combination of KOs and TKOs. A chance meeting with former heavyweight champion Shannon Briggs would lead to the opportunity of a lifetime, as Jack would earn a chance to train with Briggs in the United States. Feeling that he had gone as far as he could go in Sweden, Badou jumped at the opportunity to train with Briggs and fight the best fighters the United States could throw at him. \nBadou continued his win streak in the United States, easily overcoming his next six opponents, including the previously undefeated Alexander Brand by a split decision. With an impressive 11-0 record, Badou caught the eye of boxing legend Floyd Mayweather, who extended him the offer to join Mayweather Promotions. Naturally, Badou jumped at the chance to join this prestigious group. After racking up another handful of victories in the ring, Badou won the opportunity to challenge Marco Antonio Periban for the NABF super middleweight championship. \nUnfortunately, this fight would end in a majority draw, which would send Badou into a bit of a downward spiral. While Badou won his next fight, the fight after against Derek Edwards would result in Jack\u2019s first loss. Edwards not only won but won in the first round with a TKO; the astonished audience couldn\u2019t believe the flurry of punches that Edwards was landing on Jack. Nobody expected Edwards to win, and as a result, the fight received the Upset of the Year award in 2014.\nAfter taking a few months off to train, Badou Jack came back stronger than ever. After amassing a few more wins, Badou earned the opportunity to fight against Anthony Dirrell for the WBC Super Middleweight championship. Like Jack\u2019s previous title fight, this one was also an upset, except this time it was in Jack\u2019s favor. Badou exposed a major weakness in Dirrell\u2019s inside game and took control of the fight, eventually winning by majority decision. Badou would hold the title until January 17, 2017, when he would officially vacate it to move to the light heavyweight decision, as he felt that there were no more challenges for him in his current division.",

  "description": "Gilberto Ramirez is a professional boxer who was born on June 19, 1991, in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico. He spent most of his free time as a child at the beach with his family or training at a local boxing gym. While Ramirez began his boxing training at a young age, he did not have an extensive amateur career. He wanted to focus his time on becoming a professional boxer to earn money for his struggling family instead of fighting for free.\nSince he had no interest in participating in any prestigious amateur boxing tournaments, Gilberto Ramirez made his professional boxing career shortly after his 18th birthday. The fight took place on August 21, 2009, in his hometown of Mazatlan. The lack of experience did not stop him from knocking out Jeseth Magallanes less than a minute into the first round. The quick knockout win allowed Ramirez to take another fight eight days later against Joel Ramos, who was also knocked out in the first round.\nRamirez won 10 professional boxing matches before he turned 19. Eight of these wins were by knockout. This impressive start earned him a match against Rogelio Medina for the vacant WBC Youth middleweight title on December 17, 2010. Both boxers entered with impressive undefeated records, but Gilberto Ramriez ultimately left with the title after securing a technical knockout victory in the sixth round. He successfully defended the new title against Oney Valdez, Amilcar Edgardo Funes Melian, Samuel Miller, Jaime Barboza, Richard Gutierrez and Marcus Upshaw.\nThe long title reign let Gilberto Ramirez end 2012 with a perfect record in his first 24 professional matches. He had his first fight outside of Mexico when he fought Derrick Findlay in Glendale, California, on August 24, 2013. Ramirez was clearly nervous to start the fight, but he still rebounded to secure a unanimous decision victory. He got another title shot when he faced Giovanni Lorenzo for the vacant WBO-NABO and NABF super middleweight titles on March 11, 2014. Lorenzo got up after getting knocked down early in the first round, but he could not continue fighting after getting knocked down for a second time in the fifth round.\nRamirez successfully defended his new titles for the first time with a technical knockout victory over Junior Talipeau on July 7, 2014. He also won the vacant WBO International super middleweight title with the win over Talipeau. The WBO International and NABF super middleweight titles were successfully defended against Fulgencio Zuniga, Derek Edwards and Gevorg Khatchikian. This extended Gilberto\u2019s record to 33-0 at the end of 2015.\nStarting his career with a lengthy winning streak made Gilberto Ramirez the number one contender for Arthur Abraham\u2019s WBO super middleweight title. The match took at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 9, 2016. Abraham held the title for more than two years, but he was unable to put up much offense throughout the entire fight. Ramirez won the most prestigious title of his career with an easy unanimous decision victory. All three judges had him winning all 12 rounds of the fight. ",

  "description": "Born on April 2, 1983 in Kopeysk, Sergey Kovalev is a fearsome power puncher who earned his nickname, Krusher, through his tendency to finish his opponents. He started training in the sport fairly early on in life at age 11, and three years later he began fighting as an amateur at the 1997 Russian Boxing Junior Championship, where he took home a gold medal. He would go on to win many more amateur medals on his way to a record of 195-18 before making the jump to the professional ranks in 2009.\nKovalev had his pro debut on July 25, 2009, and he made it obvious that he had considerable power, stopping Daniel Chavez by TKO in the very first round. His next fight was another first-round TKO, followed by two stoppages immediately after the first round. Over 2009 and most of 2010, the Russian powerhouse built up a 9-0 record with every win coming by finish in the first or second round. That streak ended on October 9, 2010, when he faced off with Darnell Boone. He got dropped and had to rally back to eventually win a hard-fought split decision.\nSergey Kovalev didn\u2019t let that tough fight slow him down, though, as he continued to stay active and win fights, primarily by KO or TKO. On July 29, 2011, he won his first title, taking the NABA USA light heavyweight belt with his second-round KO over Douglas Otieno Okola. His next fight was controversial, as he stopped Grover Young with a left hook in the second round. However, the judges ruled that the blow went to the back of the head, and since Young couldn\u2019t continue, the fight was declared a technical draw.\nIn his next fight, Kovalev fought in Russia for the first time, taking on Roman Simakov for the WBC-ABCO light heavyweight title. He won the fight by seventh-round TKO, although in a tragic turn of events, Simakov went into a coma and died three days later.\nHe continued to put together impressive finishes, and by August 17, 2013, he had earned his first opportunity at a world title. He fought the tough Nathan Cleverly for the WBO light heavyweight belt, and in an excellent performance, Kovalev showcased his power and aggression. He would win in the fourth round by TKO.\nAfter three title defenses and three more finishes, he took on boxing legend Bernard Hopkins, who had tried to get into his head with trash talk. That proved to be ineffective against the stoic Russian. Despite being almost 50, Hopkins was crafty enough to make it 12 rounds, but he took a beating in the process. Sergey Kovalev took the unanimous decision and added the WBA and IBF light heavyweight titles to his collection.\nHe made four defenses of his belt collection before suffering the first loss of his career, which came against Andre Ward on November 19, 2016. Despite knocking Ward down early in the fight, he dropped a hotly disputed unanimous decision. Many in attendance scored the fight for Kovalev, but the three judges sitting ringside didn\u2019t.",

  "description": "A power puncher with a blue-collar background, Joe Smith Jr was born on September 20, 1989 and hails from Long Island, New York. He wasn\u2019t considered the next big thing in boxing growing up, as he spent quite a few years working as a laborer on construction sites. However, his love for the sport and his skill led to his decision to give professional prizefighting a try just after he turned 20.\nSmith Jr made his professional debut on October 31, 2009 against David Brown. The fight was short, as he ended up scoring a TKO in the very first round. His next fight was a first-round KO, followed by two more first-round TKOs. One thing was clear from the beginning \u2013 Joe Smith Jr had some serious power.\nOn June 26, 2010, he took on Walter Foster and won by way of TKO in the second round. The result was the same when he fought Charles Wade on July 28, 2010. However, his luck would change in his next fight on August 7, 2010, as he was stopped in the fourth-round by TKO by Eddie Caminero. At 6-3, Caminero was a bit of a step up from his previous opposition, but it was also likely that the frequency of his fights led to a down night.\nSmith Jr took some time off after that, eventually making his comeback on July 30, 2011 against Santos Martinez. He went back to his winning ways with a KO in the second round. He followed that up with four more stoppage victories. He then had a streak of decisions, as he beat Hamid Abdul-Mateen by unanimous decision, Lamont Williams by split decision and Otis Griffin by unanimous decision.\nThat proved to be an anomaly, as he would stop Michael Gbenga after two rounds and then score four consecutive TKOs before beating Will Rosinsky by unanimous decision after 10 rounds of action. A second-round TKO over Fabiano Pena earned him the biggest fight of his life, against Andrzej Fonfara on June 18, 2016 for the WBC international light heavyweight title.\nThe fight was in hostile territory, Chicago, where Fonfara was a fan favorite. Joe Smith Jr came in as a huge underdog, as most felt he would be outclassed by Fonfara. He shocked everyone in attendance and watching worldwide when he came out working the body, and then went upstairs with a beautiful right hand to knock down Fonfara. A second powerful right hand resulted in another knockdown and the end of the fight, by way of TKO in the very first round.\nFollowing up that exciting and impressive performance, he fought 51-year-old Bernard Hopkins on December 17, 2016 for the legendary boxer\u2019s final fight. While Hopkins talked quite a bit of trash in the leadup to the fight, Smith Jr was unfazed and prepared to do his talking in the ring. The fight was close for the first seven rounds, but in the eighth, he landed a brutal combination of punches that knocked Hopkins out of the ring. When Hopkins couldn\u2019t climb back in to beat the count due to an ankle injury, Joe Smith Jr became the first boxer to beat Hopkins by stoppage.",

  "description": "A mountain of a man, Luis Ortiz has a lethal combination of punching power, technical skills and physical gifts. He stands 6\u20194 but possesses a Sonny Liston-esque 84-inch reach that gives him deceptive range. Far from a wild brawler, he is a smart, efficient tactician who manages to dispatch his opponents without taking much punishment.\nBorn on March 29, 1979 in Camag\u00fcey, Cuba, Ortiz honed his craft on the Cuban National Team, where he built up a very impressive amateur record. Some reports suggest that he ended his amateur career with a record of 343-19. Despite that, he didn\u2019t quite break through on the world stage, with his best result likely being his gold at the 2005 Panamerican Championships.\nHe was 30 years old when he made his professional debut on February 16, 2010 against Lamar Davis. It didn\u2019t last long, as he took out Davis in the first round by TKO. His next fight was another TKO victory, this one in the fourth round against Charles Davis. A few months later, he won the WBC FECARBOX heavyweight title when he defeated Kendrick Releford by unanimous decision after eight rounds.\nAfter running his record to 10-0 with most of those wins coming by KO or TKO, Luis Ortiz got a shot at the WBA Fedelatin heavyweight title. He put on another strong performance when he knocked out Luis Andres Pineda in the sixth round. Four fights later, he was facing Epifanio Mendoza for the WBC and WBO Latino heavyweight titles. He controlled the fight from the opening bell until round seven, when his opponent got disqualified for an intention blow below the belt.\nWhile Ortiz was facing primarily journeymen and past-their-prime fighters, he was taking care of business by getting finishes. His boxing ability was evident to every observer, and he was clearly confident in the ring, no doubt due to his hundreds of amateur fights. He has a relaxed punching style, which enables him to throw powerful punches without loading up, and while he has killer instinct, he doesn\u2019t chase the knockout. His footwork is also very smooth for a heavyweight.\nAfter another four finishes, he fought Joseph Rabotte, who had lost 10 consecutive fights at the time. The bout was originally ruled a third-round KO for Luis Ortiz, but was later turned into a no contest when it was determined that Rabotte actually fell out of the ring.\nWith two impressive KOs, Ortiz got a shot at the WBA interim heavyweight title on September 11, 2014. He destroyed Lateef Kayode by TKO in the very first round, but he didn\u2019t keep the belt for long, as he failed a drug test, which changed the result of the fight to a no contest.\nHe got back into action nine months later after his suspension was up and scored a first-round TKO win over Byron Polley. He then proceeded to win back that WBA interim heavyweight title when he knocked out Matias Ariel Vidondo in the third round. Three fights later he added the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight title to his collection with a unanimous decision win over Malik Scott.",

  "description": "A heavyweight with truly ferocious one-punch knockout power, Deontay Wilder rode a string of KOs to become a heavyweight champion. Although he isn\u2019t the most technically sound fighter, he does possess decent fundamentals and combines that with his excellent athletic abilities to significantly outclass many opponents.\nBorn on October 22 1985 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, Wilder didn\u2019t step foot in a boxing gym until he was about to turn 20, so he started training fairly late compared to most fighters. Despite that, it didn\u2019t take long for him to show star potential, as he was winning the National Golden Gloves as an underdog less than two years later. A year later, he was going to the 2008 Olympics to fight for USA Boxing as a heavyweight. He won his first match convincingly and his second by a razor-thin tiebreaker before losing in the semis to Clemente Russo. He earned the bronze medal and gave himself the nickname \u201cThe Bronze Bomber\u201d afterwards. This was in reference to the great Joe Louis, the heavyweight legend who had the nickname \u201cThe Brown Bomber\u201d and who also came from Alabama.\nHe then decided to turn pro, and he had his first fight on November 15, 2008 against Ethan Cox. Although he had only three years of experience, he stopped Cox in the second round by TKO after scoring multiple knockdowns during the fight. Stoppages would be a theme of his fights, as he then went on to build up a nine-fight streak of first-round finishes. That came to an end on April 30, 2010, when Alvaro Morales managed to make it to the third round before getting stopped by TKO.\nAlthough Deontay Wilder wasn\u2019t fighting a high level of competition early in his career, he was destroying those he did fight, and he was fighting often. His athleticism and natural ability were both on a completely different level compared to his opposition. While he can get wild at times, he has a crisp jab that does solid damage, and his straight right hand is an absolutely brutal weapon that seems to stun fighters every time it lands.\nStaying active throughout this early portion of his career, he fought seven times in 2009 and then six times per year in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Perhaps most impressive about this was how he dominated his opponents every time. All his fights ended by either KO, TKO or a corner stoppage, and none of them made it past the fourth round. He ended up compiling a 25-0 record when he earned his first title shot, against Kelvin Price on December 15, 2012 for the WBC Continental Americas heavyweight title.\nIf he felt any nerves, he certainly didn\u2019t show it, as he took a calm approach for the first two rounds before cracking Price with a right hand clean to the jaw in the third round. He scored the KO and took home the belt in front of an excited crowd at Memorial Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California.\nAfter a second-round TKO victory over Matthew Greer, he got a step up in competition against British fighter Audley Harrison, who was a European heavyweight champion and had won an Olympic gold medal. The fight was in Sheffield, England, which was enemy territory, but it didn\u2019t matter. In the very first round, Deontay landed his trademark right hand and put Harrison on the canvas. Just days after the fight, Harrison decided to retire.\nNext on the hit list was Siarhei Liakhovich, who had been a WBO heavyweight champion but also had a year and a half of ring rust. The result was the same \u2013 a brutal right hand by Wilder, and another devastating stoppage victory in the first round. It took Liakhovich several minutes to get up and recover his senses.\nHe then faced Nicolai Firtha, who managed to make it to round four before getting knocked out. Next up was Malik Scott, and this one was another quick, clinical first-round KO. He followed that up by knocking down Jason Gavern multiple times until the fighter\u2019s corner stopped the fight after the fourth round. That ran his record up to 32-0, with every victory coming by way of stoppage.\nHe got a shot at a world heavyweight title next as he fought Bermane Stiverne on January 17, 2015 for the WBC belt. Stiverne did what no man had done before in lasting the entire 12 rounds and even fighting back well at times. However, Deontay Wilder wasn\u2019t going to be denied, as he landed over twice as many punches and won a unanimous decision by scores of 118-109, 118-109 and 120-107. He had also shown everyone that he had the cardio to go for a full fight when necessary.\nWith his WBC title, he now had the chance to defend the championship in front of his hometown fans in Birmingham, Alabama. Fighting Eric Molina on June 13, 2015, he put on a labored performance, although he scored multiple knockdowns before knocking out the Mexican-American fighter in the ninth round. He got to perform in the same arena on September 15, 2016 when he fought Johann Duhaupas, who he took out by TKO in the 11th round.\nHis next defense came on January 16, 2016 in New York, New York against Artur Szpilka. This time around, the champion had some trouble, as Szpilka\u2019s unique style and sharp technique allowed him to dodge quite a few punches and take the first three rounds. However, by the ninth round he was down on the scorecards and knew that he had to start taking more risks, so he went toe to toe with the champion. That proved to be a mistake, as Wilder cracked the challenger with a right hand and put him to sleep.\nHe went back to Birmingham for his next two fights. First, he stopped Chris Arreola after eight rounds, but he paid a heavy price, breaking his right hand and suffering a torn bicep in the fight, which kept him out the rest of the year. He returned on February 25, 2017 to take out Gerald Washington in a fifth-round TKO.",

  "description": "Dillian Whyte\u2019s dynamic boxing career is a story of perseverance and excellence. Born in Port Antonio, Jamaica, Whyte moved with his family to the United Kingdom at the age of twelve. He says that he had \u201cno schooling at all\u201d while living in Jamaica and didn\u2019t do well academically overall. He credits boxing with changing his life.\nHis fighting career began in kickboxing and MMA before turning to boxing at age 20. In his first amateur bout, he defeated Anthony Joshua, a future Olympic gold medalist. After winning five of his first six fights, his trainer Chris Okoh wanted him to remain an amateur. Due to his kickboxing background, the ABA disagreed, which led to Whyte turning pro in 2011. Boxing promoter Frank Maloney jumped at the chance to sign him after friends had seen some of his impressive sparring sessions.\nWhyte\u2019s professional career got off to a flying start. He won his first two fights by decision over Tayer Mehmed and Remigihus Ziausys within four months. His first TKO came three months later over Croatian Toni Visic, with the referee stopping the fight in the third round. Two more TKO victories came in 2012. In July of that year, Dillian Whyte fought Gabor Farkas. He knocked the six foot six inch Hungarian out in the second round for his first KO. Later on that year, after two more decisive victories, his young career took a sudden detour.\nBefore his last fight of 2012, against Sandor Balogue, Dillian Whyte took a drug test that later came back positive for Methylhexaneamin, a banned stimulant. This led to his victory over Baloque being stripped and a two year ban from competition. White had taken the supplement \u201cJack3D\u201d and insisted that he had no idea that Methylhexaneamin was in it. He lost his appeal when an independent National Anti-Doping panel felt he didn\u2019t do enough to make sure the supplement was clean, including consulting a medical professional before taking it.\nAfter two years on the shelf, White returned in 2014. He warmed up with easy victories over Ante Verunica and Tomas Mrazek. After several more victories that year and the next, including a knockout of previously undefeated Georgian Beka Lobjanidze, Dillian Whyte got his first title shot. His fight against American Brian Minto for the WBC International Silver Heavyweight Title was a part of the undercard of Anthony Joshua\u2019s title fight vs Gary Cornish. Whyte won by knockout in the third round, clinching his first title, but his clash with his old rival, Joshua was just beginning.\nSince his first amateur victory over Joshua six years earlier, the two had trained together in heavyweight superstar Wladimir Klitschko\u2019s camps in Austria. After words were exchanged in the press, Whyte confronted Joshua and insisted on a long awaited rematch with the vacant British heavyweight title on the line. In September of 2015, Dillian got his shot. But Joshua proved to be more than a match for him this time around. After six hard fought rounds, Joshua landed an uppercut that knocked him out.\nThe setback of the loss to Joshua and subsequent shoulder surgery did not stop Dillian Whyte on his quest for the British heavyweight title. In 2016 he fought Ian Lewison for the once again vacated belt. Though he had mocked Lewison\u2019s weight at the press conference, leading to a near brawl between the two, the match turned out to be well contested. Whyte was victorious when, after ten rounds, the fight was stopped due to a nose problem with Lewison. He had finally achieved the coveted British Heavyweight Championship.\nHaving gone from Port Antonio to major title bouts at the O2 arena, Dillian White has never lost his genuine love for the sweet science of boxing. \u201cI treat all bouts and shows with the same commitment and look forward to every fight,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s a small hall or an arena show it makes no difference to me.\u201d It\u2019s that true love for the sport that has gotten him through setbacks in a career that continues to climb.",
